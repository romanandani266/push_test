### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

## **Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system must adhere to regulations such as **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, and **PCI-DSS**, depending on the nature of the data being processed. Below is a detailed breakdown of the applicable standards, their requirements, and how the system will meet them.

---

### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

#### **Applicability**
GDPR applies if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU). This includes user data such as `username`, `email`, and `role`.

#### **Compliance Requirements**
1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
2. **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
3. **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
5. **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
6. **Data Retention Policy**: Define and enforce a policy for retaining and deleting personal data.

#### **Implementation in the System**
- **Data Minimization**: Only store `username`, `email`, and `role` in the `Users` table. Avoid storing unnecessary personal data.
- **Consent Management**: Add a consent field in the `Users` table to track user consent.
- **Right to Access and Erasure**: Implement APIs to allow users to view and delete their data.
- **Data Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Set up automated alerts and workflows for breach notifications.
- **Data Retention Policy**: Define a policy to delete inactive user accounts after a specified period.

### **2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

#### **Applicability**
HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). If the system does not handle PHI, this regulation may not be applicable.

#### **Compliance Requirements**
1. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
2. **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all data access and modifications.
3. **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
5. **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Ensure third-party vendors comply with HIPAA.

#### **Implementation in the System**
- **Access Control**: Use the `role` field in the `Users` table to enforce RBAC.
- **Audit Controls**: Add an audit log table to track all data access and changes.
- **Data Integrity**: Use database constraints and triggers to prevent unauthorized data modifications.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data using industry-standard algorithms.
- **BAAs**: Ensure all third-party vendors (e.g., cloud providers) sign BAAs.

### **3. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**

#### **Applicability**
PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information. If the system does not handle payments, this regulation may not be applicable.

#### **Compliance Requirements**
1. **Secure Storage**: Do not store sensitive cardholder data unless absolutely necessary.
2. **Encryption**: Encrypt cardholder data using strong cryptography.
3. **Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis.
4. **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly test the system for vulnerabilities.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Monitor and log all access to cardholder data.

#### **Implementation in the System**
- **Secure Storage**: Avoid storing cardholder data. Use third-party payment processors.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt any payment-related data using PCI-compliant methods.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to payment-related data using RBAC.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement logging for all payment-related activities.

### **4. Security Measures**

#### **Data Security**
- **Encryption**: Use AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **Access Control**: Implement RBAC using the `role` field in the `Users` table.
- **Firewalls**: Deploy firewalls to protect the system from unauthorized access.

#### **Data Privacy**
- **Anonymization**: Anonymize sensitive data where possible.
- **Data Masking**: Mask sensitive fields (e.g., `email`) in non-production environments.
- **Consent Management**: Track user consent for data processing.

#### **Audit Controls**
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of all data access and modifications.
- **Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
- **Reporting**: Generate compliance reports for audits.

---

### **5. Validation of Compliance**

#### **During Implementation**
1. **Code Reviews**: Conduct code reviews to ensure compliance with encryption and access control requirements.
2. **Penetration Testing**: Perform penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
3. **Compliance Checklists**: Use checklists to verify adherence to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

#### **After Implementation**
1. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure ongoing compliance.
2. **Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools to detect and respond to compliance violations.
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from users to identify potential compliance issues.

---

### **6. Updates to Database Schema**

To support compliance requirements, the following updates will be made to the database schema:

#### **Users Table**
- Add a `consent` field (Boolean, Default: False) to track user consent.
- Add a `last_login` field (Timestamp) to track user activity.

#### **Audit Logs Table**
- **Fields**:
  - `log_id` (Primary Key, Integer, Auto-increment)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key, Integer, References `users.user_id`, Not Null)
  - `action` (String, Not Null)
  - `timestamp` (Timestamp, Default: Current Timestamp)
