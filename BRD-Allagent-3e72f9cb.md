### 13. **Data Flow Validation**
#### **Objective**
To ensure the proper handling, routing, and transformation of data between systems and components, adhering to business goals, data privacy standards, and performance requirements.

#### **Data Flow Analysis**
##### **Data Sources**
1. **User Input**: Data entered by retail partners, warehouse managers, and supply chain team members via the web-based interface.
2. **Sales Data**: Historical and real-time sales data imported from external ERP systems.
3. **Inventory Updates**: Real-time updates from warehouse systems or manual adjustments by authorized users.

##### **Data Transformations**
1. **User Authentication**: User credentials are validated against the `Users` table, and role-based access control (RBAC) is applied.
2. **Inventory Tracking**:
   - Stock levels are updated in the `Products` table.
   - Changes are logged in the `Inventory Logs` table.
3. **Sales Trend Analysis**:
   - Sales data is aggregated and analyzed to predict future demand.
   - Results are displayed on the dashboard for decision-making.
4. **Restocking Alerts**:
   - Stock levels are compared against threshold levels.
   - Alerts are generated and stored in the `Restocking Alerts` table if thresholds are breached.

##### **Data Destinations**
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL database for secure storage of all data.
2. **User Interface**: Real-time data displayed on the dashboard for stakeholders.
3. **Notifications**: Automated alerts sent via email or SMS to relevant users.

#### **Validation Criteria**
