- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage and efficient querying.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS or Microsoft Azure for hosting the application, ensuring scalability and high availability.
- **Notification Service**: Integration with email/SMS APIs (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid) for automated restocking alerts.
- **Data Visualization**: Libraries like D3.js or Chart.js for creating interactive dashboards and reports.

### 12.3 Integration Requirements
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Data Import/Export**: Support for CSV or Excel file formats to import historical sales data and export inventory reports.
- **Authentication**: Integration with OAuth 2.0 or SAML for secure user authentication.

### 12.4 Performance Requirements
- The system should support at least 500 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- Inventory updates should reflect in the system within 2 seconds of a change.

### 12.5 Security Requirements
- **Encryption**: Use HTTPS for secure data transmission and AES-256 for data encryption at rest.
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of all user activities for compliance and troubleshooting.

### 12.6 Scalability and Availability
- The system should be designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to handle increased load.
- Ensure 99.9% uptime through load balancing and failover mechanisms.
