## 9. Technical Requirements

### 9.1 System Capabilities
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: The system must process and display inventory data in real time.
- **Scalability**: The system must support multiple retail locations and scale as the number of users and data grows.
- **Integration**: The system must integrate with existing inventory databases and ERP systems used by PepsiCo and retail partners.

### 9.2 Technologies and Tools
- **Frontend**: React.js or Angular for building a responsive and user-friendly web interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python (Django/Flask) for handling business logic and API development.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for secure and efficient data storage.
- **Hosting Platform**: AWS or Microsoft Azure for cloud hosting, ensuring high availability and scalability.
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js or D3.js for creating interactive sales trend analysis charts.
- **Notification System**: Twilio or Firebase for sending automated restocking alerts via email or SMS.

### 9.3 Security Measures
- **Authentication**: Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for secure user authentication.
- **Encryption**: Implement SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can access specific features.
- **Data Backup**: Regular automated backups to prevent data loss.

### 9.4 Performance and Scalability
- The system must handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- The system must support a database size of up to 1TB, with the ability to scale further as needed.
- Response time for key operations (e.g., viewing stock levels, generating alerts) must not exceed 2 seconds.

### 9.5 Integration Considerations
- The system must integrate with existing ERP systems (e.g., SAP) via RESTful APIs.
- The system must support data import/export in CSV and JSON formats for compatibility with external tools.

### 9.6 Development and Testing Tools
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for source code management.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins or GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest (for frontend), PyTest (for backend), and Selenium (for end-to-end testing).
