# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Project Name
[To be determined]

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The retail industry faces challenges in managing inventory efficiently, leading to overstocking, understocking, and waste. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a simple and efficient retail inventory management system. The system will provide real-time tracking of product stock levels, predict restocking needs, and minimize waste, ultimately improving operational efficiency and reducing costs.

### 1.2 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the business and technical requirements for the development of a retail inventory management system. It serves as a guide for all stakeholders involved in the project to ensure alignment on objectives, scope, and deliverables.

---

## 2. Business Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a retail inventory management system that:
- Tracks product stock levels in real-time.
- Predicts restocking needs based on sales trends and inventory data.
- Minimizes waste by optimizing inventory levels.

---

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In-Scope
The project will include the following:
- Development of a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Implementation of automated stock alert notifications.
- Integration of sales trend analysis to predict restocking needs.

### 3.2 Out-of-Scope
- Mobile application development.
- Integration with third-party logistics systems.
- Advanced AI/ML-based demand forecasting (beyond basic sales trend analysis).

---

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements
1. **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**:
   - The system must provide real-time updates on stock levels for all products.
   - Users should be able to view inventory levels by product, category, and location.

2. **Automated Restocking Alerts**:
   - Notifications should be sent automatically when stock levels fall below a predefined threshold.
   - Alerts should be configurable based on product type and location.

3. **Sales Trend Analysis**:
   - The system should analyze historical sales data to predict future restocking needs.
   - Provide visual dashboards for sales trends and inventory forecasts.

4. **User Management**:
   - Role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Manager, Viewer).
   - Secure login and authentication for all users.

5. **Reporting**:
   - Generate reports on inventory levels, sales trends, and restocking recommendations.
   - Export reports in CSV and PDF formats.

## 7. Regulatory and Compliance Standards

### 7.1 Overview
To ensure the system complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following regulations have been identified as applicable to the project:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** (Applicable for users in the EU)
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)** (Applicable if payment data is processed)
3. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** (Applicable for users in California, USA)

---

### 7.2 Compliance Requirements and Implementation

#### 1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Data minimization: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
     - User consent: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
     - Right to access: Allow users to view and download their personal data.
     - Right to erasure: Allow users to request the deletion of their personal data.
     - Data breach notification: Notify users and authorities within 72 hours of a data breach.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Add a consent management module for user data collection.
     - Implement a "My Data" section for users to view, download, or delete their data.
     - Encrypt all sensitive data in transit and at rest.
     - Set up automated alerts for potential data breaches.

#### 2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Encrypt payment data using strong encryption algorithms.
     - Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.
     - Regularly test and monitor the system for vulnerabilities.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use a third-party payment gateway to handle payment processing.
     - Ensure the payment gateway is PCI-DSS certified.
     - Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

#### 3. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Provide a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" option.
     - Allow users to request access to the personal data collected about them.
     - Allow users to request the deletion of their personal data.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Add a "Do Not Sell My Data" button to the user interface.
     - Implement a data access and deletion request workflow.
     - Maintain an audit log of all data access and deletion requests.

---

### 7.3 Security Measures
- **Data Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement automated daily backups and a disaster recovery plan.

---

### 7.4 Data Privacy Rules
- **Data Retention**: Retain user data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the system's purpose.
- **Anonymization**: Anonymize data that is no longer needed for operational purposes.
- **User Consent**: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.

---

### 7.5 Audit Controls
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain detailed logs of all user activities, including logins, data access, and modifications.
- **Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities in real-time.
- **Compliance Reports**: Generate periodic compliance reports to demonstrate adherence to regulatory standards.

---

### 7.6 Validation of Compliance
- **During Implementation**:
  - Conduct a compliance review at each development milestone.
  - Perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
  - Validate encryption and access control mechanisms.
- **Post-Implementation**:
  - Conduct an external compliance audit.
  - Monitor the system for ongoing compliance using automated tools.
  - Update the system to reflect changes in regulatory requirements.

## 8. Conclusion

The addition of regulatory and compliance standards ensures that the retail inventory management system adheres to all relevant laws and regulations. This not only protects user data but also builds trust with stakeholders and end-users. The outlined measures and validation steps will ensure compliance during and after implementation.
