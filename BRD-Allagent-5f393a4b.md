## **6. Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

### **6.1 Applicable Regulations**
Based on the business requirements and the nature of the solution, the following compliance standards are applicable:
1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable if the system processes personal data of EU residents.
2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Applicable if the system handles protected health information (PHI).
3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system processes payment card information.
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system processes personal data of California residents.

### **6.2 Compliance Requirements and Implementation**

#### **1. GDPR**
- **Requirements**:
  - Data minimization: Collect only the data necessary for the purpose.
  - Consent management: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
  - Right to access, rectify, and delete data (Data Subject Rights).
  - Data breach notification within 72 hours.
  - Data encryption and pseudonymization.
- **Implementation**:
  - Implement a consent management module for user data.
  - Provide user interfaces for data access, rectification, and deletion.
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
  - Establish a data breach response plan and notification mechanism.

#### **2. HIPAA**
- **Requirements**:
  - Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI.
  - Implement access controls and audit trails.
  - Encrypt PHI during storage and transmission.
  - Conduct regular risk assessments and staff training.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to PHI.
  - Log all access and modifications to PHI in the Audit_Logs table.
  - Encrypt PHI using industry-standard algorithms.
  - Schedule periodic risk assessments and compliance audits.

#### **3. PCI-DSS**
- **Requirements**:
  - Protect cardholder data through encryption and secure storage.
  - Implement strong access control measures.
  - Regularly test security systems and processes.
  - Maintain a secure network and monitor access.
- **Implementation**:
  - Store payment data in a separate, encrypted database.
  - Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to secure the network.
  - Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
  - Monitor and log all access to payment data.

#### **4. CCPA**
- **Requirements**:
  - Provide users with the right to know what data is collected and how it is used.
  - Allow users to opt-out of data selling.
  - Ensure data deletion upon user request.
- **Implementation**:
  - Add a "Do Not Sell My Data" option in the user interface.
  - Implement a data deletion workflow for user requests.
  - Maintain a transparent privacy policy accessible to users.

---

## **7. Security Measures**
To ensure compliance and data protection, the following security measures will be implemented:
1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt all sensitive data at rest using AES-256.
   - Use TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit.
2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement RBAC to restrict access based on user roles.
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.
3. **Audit Controls**:
   - Log all user actions in the Audit_Logs table.
   - Monitor logs for suspicious activities using automated tools.
4. **Data Masking**:
   - Mask sensitive data in non-production environments.
5. **Regular Security Testing**:
   - Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments quarterly.

## **8. Compliance Validation**

### **8.1 During Implementation**
- Conduct a compliance gap analysis to identify and address any deficiencies.
- Perform regular code reviews to ensure adherence to security and compliance standards.
- Use automated tools to validate encryption, access controls, and data masking.

### **8.2 Post-Implementation**
- Schedule periodic compliance audits by internal and external auditors.
- Monitor system logs and alerts for potential compliance violations.
- Update policies and procedures to reflect changes in regulations.

## **9. Database Schema**

### **Overview**
The database schema is designed to support the functional and compliance requirements of the system. It is normalized to avoid redundancy, ensure data integrity, and facilitate auditing.

### **9.1 Tables**

  - `id` (Primary Key, UUID): Unique identifier for each user.
  - `username` (VARCHAR, Unique, Not Null): User's chosen username.
  - `email` (VARCHAR, Unique, Not Null): User's email address.
  - `password_hash` (VARCHAR, Not Null): Hashed password for security.
  - `role` (ENUM: 'admin', 'user', 'manager', etc., Default: 'user'): Role-based access control.
  - `consent` (BOOLEAN, Default: TRUE): Indicates if the user has provided consent for data processing (GDPR).
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of user creation.
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP): Timestamp of last update.

#### **2. Audit_Logs**
