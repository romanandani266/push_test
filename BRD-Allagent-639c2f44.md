# Project Requirements

To ensure the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following updates and additions will be made to the Business Requirements Document (BRD). These updates will address compliance requirements, security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls. Additionally, instructions for validating compliance during and after implementation will be provided.

## **20. Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

### **Applicable Compliance Standards**
Based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU).
2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Applicable if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI).
3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system processes payment card information.
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system processes personal data of California residents.
5. **ISO/IEC 27001**: Recommended for establishing an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

### **Compliance Requirements and Implementation**

#### **1. GDPR**
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Data Minimization: Collect only the data necessary for the specified purpose.
  - Data Subject Rights: Provide mechanisms for users to access, rectify, delete, or export their data.
  - Data Breach Notification: Notify authorities and affected individuals within 72 hours of a data breach.
  - Data Protection by Design and Default: Implement technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection.
  - Data Processing Agreements (DPAs): Ensure contracts with third-party processors comply with GDPR.

- **Implementation**:
  - Add a "Privacy Policy" page to inform users about data collection, processing, and their rights.
  - Implement user interfaces for data access, rectification, and deletion requests.
  - Encrypt personal data at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS 1.2/1.3.
  - Maintain an audit log of all data access and modifications.
  - Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing activities.

#### **2. HIPAA**
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Access Controls: Restrict access to PHI based on roles and responsibilities.
  - Audit Controls: Maintain logs of all access to PHI.
  - Data Encryption: Encrypt PHI at rest and in transit.
  - Business Associate Agreements (BAAs): Ensure contracts with third-party vendors comply with HIPAA.
  - Breach Notification: Notify affected individuals and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in case of a breach.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to PHI.
  - Encrypt PHI using AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.2/1.3 for data in transit.
  - Implement logging and monitoring tools to track access to PHI.
  - Conduct regular risk assessments and vulnerability scans.
  - Train employees on HIPAA compliance and data handling best practices.

#### **3. PCI-DSS**
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Secure Network: Use firewalls and secure configurations for all systems.
  - Protect Cardholder Data: Encrypt payment card data and avoid storing sensitive authentication data.
  - Access Control: Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis.
  - Regular Monitoring: Monitor and test networks regularly for vulnerabilities.
  - Incident Response: Develop and maintain an incident response plan.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use a PCI-compliant payment gateway to process payment card information.
  - Do not store sensitive authentication data (e.g., CVV codes) after authorization.
  - Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS).
  - Conduct quarterly vulnerability scans and annual penetration tests.
  - Maintain a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) with code reviews and security testing.

#### **4. CCPA**
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Data Access and Deletion: Allow California residents to access and delete their personal data.
  - Opt-Out Mechanism: Provide a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" option.
  - Data Security: Implement reasonable security measures to protect personal data.
  - Privacy Policy: Clearly disclose data collection and usage practices.

- **Implementation**:
  - Add a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link to the website.
  - Implement user interfaces for data access and deletion requests.
  - Encrypt personal data and use secure APIs for data transmission.
  - Update the Privacy Policy to include CCPA-specific disclosures.

#### **5. ISO/IEC 27001**
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Risk Management: Identify, assess, and mitigate information security risks.
  - Access Control: Implement policies to restrict access to sensitive data.
  - Incident Management: Develop and test an incident response plan.
  - Continuous Improvement: Regularly review and improve the ISMS.

- **Implementation**:
  - Establish an ISMS and document all security policies and procedures.
  - Conduct regular internal audits and management reviews.
  - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative accounts.
  - Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for real-time monitoring.

### **21. Security Measures**

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt all sensitive data at rest using AES-256.
   - Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.2/1.3.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Maintain logs of all data access, modifications, and deletions.
   - Use a centralized logging system for monitoring and analysis.

4. **Network Security**:
   - Use firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS).
   - Regularly update and patch all software and systems.

5. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize or pseudonymize personal data where possible.

---

### **22. Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the specified purpose.
   - Implement automated data deletion policies.

2. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the data necessary for the specified purpose.

3. **User Consent**:
