## 10. Compliance Standards and Requirements

To ensure the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. This section outlines the applicable regulations, their requirements, and how the system will meet them. Additionally, security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls are documented to ensure compliance.

### 10.1 Applicable Compliance Standards

Based on the business requirements and the nature of the system, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the collection and processing of user data, including email addresses and hashed passwords.
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system integrates with payment processing systems.
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Applicable only if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). (Currently not applicable unless explicitly stated.)
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system serves California residents and meets the CCPA thresholds for data collection.

### 10.2 Compliance Requirements and Implementation

#### 1. **GDPR Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Data minimization: Only collect data necessary for the system's functionality.
     - User consent: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
     - Right to access and delete: Allow users to access and delete their data.
     - Data security: Implement measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access.
     - Data breach notification: Notify users and authorities in case of a data breach.

   - **Implementation**:
     - **Data Minimization**: Limit user data collection to `email`, `password_hash`, and `role`.
     - **User Consent**: Add a consent mechanism during user registration.
     - **Access and Deletion**: Provide a user interface for users to view and delete their data.
     - **Data Security**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., `password_hash`) and use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
     - **Breach Notification**: Implement a monitoring system to detect breaches and notify stakeholders within 72 hours.

#### 2. **PCI-DSS Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Secure storage of payment data.
     - Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.
     - Encrypt transmission of payment data.
     - Regularly test security systems and processes.

   - **Implementation**:
     - **Secure Storage**: Use tokenization or encryption for payment data storage.
     - **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to payment data.
     - **Encryption**: Use TLS/SSL for all data transmissions involving payment information.
     - **Security Testing**: Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

#### 3. **CCPA Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Right to know: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
     - Right to delete: Allow users to request deletion of their data.
     - Opt-out: Provide an option to opt-out of data selling (if applicable).
     - Data security: Protect personal data from unauthorized access.

   - **Implementation**:
     - **Transparency**: Update the privacy policy to include details about data collection and usage.
     - **Deletion Requests**: Implement a mechanism for users to request data deletion.
     - **Opt-Out**: Provide an opt-out mechanism for data sharing (if applicable).
     - **Data Security**: Use encryption and access controls to secure personal data.

### 10.3 Security Measures

To ensure compliance with the above standards, the following security measures will be implemented:

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256.
   - Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement RBAC to restrict access based on user roles (`admin`, `manager`, `staff`).
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Maintain logs of all user activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
   - Store logs securely and ensure they are tamper-proof.

4. **Regular Security Assessments**:
   - Conduct vulnerability scans and penetration tests quarterly.
   - Update software and dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

5. **Incident Response Plan**:
   - Develop and document an incident response plan to handle security breaches.
   - Train staff on incident response procedures.

### 10.4 Data Privacy Rules

1. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain user data only as long as necessary for business operations.
   - Automatically delete inactive user accounts after a specified period (e.g., 12 months).

2. **Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize data used for analytics to prevent identification of individuals.

3. **Third-Party Data Sharing**:
   - Ensure third-party vendors comply with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.
   - Sign data processing agreements (DPAs) with all third-party vendors.

---

### 10.5 Audit Controls

1. **Automated Monitoring**:
   - Use automated tools to monitor system activities and detect anomalies.

2. **Access Audits**:
   - Regularly review access logs to ensure compliance with RBAC policies.

3. **Compliance Audits**:
   - Conduct annual audits to verify compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.

4. **Reporting**:
   - Generate compliance reports for stakeholders and regulatory authorities.

### 10.6 Validation of Compliance

#### During Implementation:
   - Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to identify and mitigate risks.
   - Perform security testing to validate encryption, access controls, and other measures.
   - Review the system design against compliance checklists for GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.

#### After Implementation:
   - Schedule regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to regulations.
   - Monitor system logs and alerts for potential compliance violations.
   - Update policies and procedures to reflect changes in regulations.
