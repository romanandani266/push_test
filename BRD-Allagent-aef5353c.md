# Project Requirements

### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

## Project Name: Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 18. **Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. This section outlines the applicable regulations, their requirements, and how the system will meet them.

---

#### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

**Applicability**: GDPR applies as the system may handle personal data of users (e.g., names, email addresses, and roles).

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
- **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent from users for storing and processing their personal data.
- **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Minimization**: Limit user data collection to `name`, `email`, `password`, and `role`.
- **Consent Management**: Add a consent checkbox during user registration.
- **Access and Erasure**: Provide a user interface for users to view and delete their data.
- **Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **Breach Notification**: Implement automated alerts for potential breaches and maintain a response plan.

**Validation**:
- Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.
- Perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

#### **2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

**Applicability**: HIPAA applies if the system is used in healthcare settings to manage inventory of medical supplies.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.
- **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to sensitive data.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Ensure third-party vendors comply with HIPAA.

**Implementation**:
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data.
- **Audit Controls**: Use the `Audit Logs` table to track all actions performed by users.
- **Data Integrity**: Use database constraints and triggers to prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **BAAs**: Require vendors to sign BAAs before accessing the system.

**Validation**:
- Conduct HIPAA compliance audits.
- Test access control mechanisms to ensure proper enforcement.

---

#### **3. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**

**Applicability**: PCI-DSS applies if the system integrates payment processing for inventory purchases.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Secure Network**: Use firewalls and secure configurations to protect cardholder data.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt cardholder data both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel only.
- **Monitoring and Testing**: Regularly monitor and test networks for vulnerabilities.
- **Incident Response**: Maintain a plan for responding to security incidents.

**Implementation**:
- **Secure Network**: Use firewalls and secure configurations for servers.
- **Data Protection**: Do not store cardholder data directly; use tokenization or third-party payment processors.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to payment-related data to authorized users.
- **Monitoring and Testing**: Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) and conduct regular vulnerability scans.
- **Incident Response**: Develop and test an incident response plan.

**Validation**:
- Obtain PCI-DSS certification through an approved Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).
- Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.

#### **4. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**

**Applicability**: CCPA applies if the system is used by businesses operating in California and meets the CCPA thresholds.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Data Transparency**: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
- **Opt-Out Option**: Allow users to opt out of data collection and sale.
- **Data Access and Deletion**: Provide users with access to their data and the ability to request its deletion.
- **Non-Discrimination**: Do not discriminate against users who exercise their CCPA rights.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Transparency**: Add a privacy policy outlining data collection practices.
- **Opt-Out Option**: Provide an opt-out mechanism in the user interface.
- **Access and Deletion**: Implement features for users to view and delete their data.
- **Non-Discrimination**: Ensure all users have equal access to system features regardless of their data preferences.

**Validation**:
- Conduct CCPA compliance audits.
- Test the opt-out and data deletion mechanisms.

### 19. **Security Measures**

To ensure compliance with the above regulations, the following security measures will be implemented:

1. **Encryption**:
   - Use AES-256 for data at rest.
   - Use TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Log all user actions in the `Audit Logs` table.
   - Retain logs for a minimum of 5 years.

4. **Data Masking**:
   - Mask sensitive data (e.g., passwords) in logs and user interfaces.

5. **Regular Audits**:
   - Conduct quarterly security audits.
   - Perform annual compliance audits for GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.

6. **Incident Response**:
   - Develop and test an incident response plan.
   - Maintain a 24/7 monitoring system for potential breaches.

---

### 20. **Validation and Testing**

To validate compliance during and after implementation, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Pre-Implementation**:
   - Conduct a compliance gap analysis.
   - Review the database schema and system architecture for compliance.

2. **During Implementation**:
   - Perform unit testing for access control and encryption features.
   - Conduct integration testing for third-party services (e.g., payment processors).

3. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
   - Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure compliance features are functional.

4. **Ongoing Validation**:
   - Schedule regular compliance audits.
   - Monitor system logs for suspicious activity.

### Conclusion

The Retail Inventory Management System is designed to comply with GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and CCPA. By implementing the outlined security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls, the system will ensure regulatory compliance and protect user data. Regular validation and testing will maintain compliance throughout the system's lifecycle.
