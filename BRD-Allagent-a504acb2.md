# Project Requirements

To ensure the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following updates and additions will be made to the Business Requirements Document (BRD). These updates will address compliance requirements, security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls. Additionally, instructions for validating compliance during and after implementation will be provided.

## 9. Regulatory and Compliance Standards

### Overview
The system must comply with applicable regulatory and compliance standards to ensure data security, privacy, and integrity. Based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed, the following regulations are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** - Applicable if the system processes personal data of EU residents.
2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** - Applicable if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI).
3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)** - Applicable if the system processes payment card information.
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** - Applicable if the system processes personal data of California residents.

### 9.1 GDPR Compliance

#### Compliance Requirements:
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and process data necessary for the system's functionality.
- **Data Subject Rights**: Provide mechanisms for users to access, rectify, or delete their data.
- **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data at rest and in transit.

#### Implementation in the System:
- **Data Minimization**: Ensure only necessary fields (e.g., `username`, `role`) are collected in the `Users` table.
- **Data Subject Rights**: Add APIs or user interfaces for data access, rectification, and deletion.
- **Consent Management**: Implement a consent management module for user registration and data processing.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Integrate automated alerts for potential breaches and establish a notification process.
- **Data Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.

---

### 9.2 HIPAA Compliance

#### Compliance Requirements:
- **Access Controls**: Restrict access to PHI based on user roles.
- **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt PHI at rest and in transit.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
- **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Ensure third-party vendors comply with HIPAA.

#### Implementation in the System:
- **Access Controls**: Use the `role` field in the `Users` table to enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Audit Controls**: Use the `Logs` table to track all access and modifications to sensitive data.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive fields in the database and use secure communication protocols.
- **Data Integrity**: Implement checksums and hashing mechanisms to verify data integrity.
- **BAAs**: Establish agreements with third-party vendors handling PHI.

### 9.3 PCI-DSS Compliance

#### Compliance Requirements:
- **Secure Authentication**: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user access.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt payment card data at rest and in transit.
- **Access Controls**: Restrict access to payment card data to authorized personnel only.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and apply patches.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs of all access to payment card data.

#### Implementation in the System:
- **Secure Authentication**: Integrate MFA for user login.
- **Data Encryption**: Use tokenization for payment card data and encrypt it using AES-256.
- **Access Controls**: Restrict access to payment card data using RBAC.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Schedule regular vulnerability scans and updates.
- **Audit Trails**: Use the `Logs` table to track access to payment card data.

---

### 9.4 CCPA Compliance

#### Compliance Requirements:
- **Data Access Requests**: Allow users to request access to their personal data.
- **Data Deletion Requests**: Allow users to request deletion of their personal data.
- **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Provide an option for users to opt out of data selling.
- **Data Security**: Implement reasonable security measures to protect personal data.

#### Implementation in the System:
- **Data Access Requests**: Add APIs or user interfaces for data access requests.
- **Data Deletion Requests**: Add APIs or user interfaces for data deletion requests.
- **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Implement an opt-out feature in the user settings.
- **Data Security**: Use encryption, access controls, and regular security audits.

---

### 9.5 Security Measures

1. **Encryption**:
   - Use AES-256 for data at rest.
   - Use TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.

2. **Access Controls**:
   - Implement RBAC using the `role` field in the `Users` table.
   - Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Use the `Logs` table to track all access, modifications, and deletions of sensitive data.
   - Include timestamps and user identifiers in log entries.

4. **Vulnerability Management**:
   - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
   - Apply security patches promptly.

5. **Incident Response**:
   - Establish an incident response plan for data breaches.
   - Conduct regular drills to test the plan.

### 9.6 Data Privacy Rules

1. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the data necessary for system functionality.

2. **Data Retention**:
   - Define retention periods for each type of data and implement automated deletion.

3. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize data used for analytics to protect user privacy.

4. **Consent Management**:
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
