### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

### 16. **Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system must adhere to regulations such as **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, **PCI-DSS**, and other applicable standards based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed.

---

#### **Applicable Compliance Standards**

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
   - **Applicability**: GDPR applies if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU).  
   - **Compliance Requirements**:  
     - **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's operation (e.g., user data like `username`, `email`, and `role`).  
     - **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.  
     - **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.  
     - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.  
     - **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.  
   - **Implementation in the System**:  
     - Encrypt sensitive fields like `password_hash` and `email`.  
     - Implement a user interface for data access and deletion requests.  
     - Log and monitor access to personal data in the `Audit Logs` table.  
     - Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for data transmission.  

2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**  
   - **Applicability**: HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI).  
   - **Compliance Requirements**:  
     - **Access Control**: Restrict access to PHI based on user roles.  
     - **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.  
     - **Data Integrity**: Ensure that PHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.  
     - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.  
   - **Implementation in the System**:  
     - Use the `Audit Logs` table to track access and changes to sensitive data.  
     - Implement role-based access control using the `Users` table (`role` field).  
     - Encrypt sensitive data fields and ensure secure backups.  

3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**  
   - **Applicability**: PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information.  
   - **Compliance Requirements**:  
     - **Data Protection**: Do not store sensitive cardholder data unless absolutely necessary.  
     - **Access Control**: Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.  
     - **Encryption**: Encrypt payment data both in transit and at rest.  
     - **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly test the system for vulnerabilities.  
   - **Implementation in the System**:  
     - Avoid storing payment card information in the database.  
     - Use third-party payment processors that are PCI-DSS compliant.  
     - Implement strong access controls and encryption for any payment-related data.  

4. **Other Standards** (e.g., CCPA, ISO 27001)  
   - **Applicability**: These may apply based on the geographic location and industry of the business.  
   - **Compliance Requirements**:  
     - Follow similar principles of data protection, access control, and auditability.

#### **Security Measures**

1. **Data Encryption**  
   - Encrypt sensitive data fields such as `password_hash`, `email`, and any other personal or sensitive information.  
   - Use industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).  

2. **Access Control**  
   - Implement role-based access control using the `Users` table (`role` field).  
   - Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Viewer).  

3. **Secure Communication**  
   - Use HTTPS for all data transmission.  
   - Implement SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication.  

4. **Audit Logs**  
   - Use the `Audit Logs` table to track all user actions and system changes.  
   - Include fields such as `user_id`, `action`, and `timestamp` to ensure traceability.  

5. **Data Backup and Recovery**  
   - Regularly back up the database to prevent data loss.  
   - Encrypt backup files and store them in a secure location.  

6. **Vulnerability Management**  
   - Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing.  
   - Apply security patches and updates promptly.

#### **Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Minimization**  
   - Only collect and store data necessary for the system's operation.  
   - Avoid storing sensitive data like payment card information unless required.  

2. **User Consent**  
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.  
   - Provide users with clear information about how their data will be used.  

3. **Data Retention**  
   - Define a data retention policy to delete data that is no longer needed.  
   - Implement automated scripts to purge old data from the database.  

4. **Right to Access and Erasure**  
   - Provide users with a mechanism to access their data and request its deletion.  
   - Log all data access and deletion requests in the `Audit Logs` table.  

---

#### **Audit Controls**

1. **Logging**  
   - Log all user actions (e.g., login, data access, CRUD operations) in the `Audit Logs` table.  
   - Include details such as `user_id`, `action`, and `timestamp`.  

2. **Monitoring**  
   - Implement monitoring tools to detect suspicious activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts).  
   - Set up alerts for critical events such as data breaches or unauthorized access.  

3. **Regular Audits**  
   - Conduct regular audits of the `Audit Logs` table to ensure compliance.  
   - Review access logs to identify and address potential security issues.  

---

#### **Validation of Compliance**

1. **During Implementation**  
   - Conduct a compliance review at each stage of development.  
   - Use automated tools to test for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.  
   - Perform data encryption and access control tests.  

2. **Post-Implementation**  
   - Conduct a final compliance audit before deploying the system.  
   - Use third-party auditors to validate compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards.  
   - Implement continuous monitoring to ensure ongoing compliance.  

3. **Documentation**  
   - Maintain detailed documentation of compliance measures, including policies, procedures, and audit logs.  
   - Provide training to employees on compliance requirements and best practices.
