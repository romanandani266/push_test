## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Background**
The retail industry faces challenges in managing inventory efficiently, leading to overstocking, understocking, and waste. To address these issues, this project aims to develop a simple and efficient retail inventory management system. The system will help retail partners, PepsiCo's supply chain team, and warehouse managers streamline inventory tracking, predict restocking needs, and minimize waste.

### **1.2 Purpose of the Document**
This document outlines the business and technical requirements for the development of a retail inventory management system. It serves as a reference for stakeholders, ensuring alignment on the project’s objectives, scope, deliverables, and compliance with relevant regulatory standards.

---

## **2. Business Objectives**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a retail inventory management system that:
- Tracks product stock levels in real-time.
- Predicts restocking needs based on sales trends and inventory data.
- Minimizes waste by optimizing inventory levels.
- Ensures compliance with applicable regulatory and data protection standards.

---

## **3. Scope**

### **3.1 In-Scope**
The project will include the following:
- Development of a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Implementation of automated stock alert notifications.
- Integration of sales trend analysis for predictive restocking.
- Incorporation of compliance measures for data privacy, security, and auditability.

### **3.2 Out-of-Scope**
- Mobile application development (Phase 2 consideration).
- Integration with third-party logistics systems (future scope).
- Advanced AI/ML-based demand forecasting (future scope).

## **4. Requirements**

### **4.1 Functional Requirements**
1. **Real-Time Inventory Tracking:**  
   - The system must provide real-time updates on stock levels for all products.
   - Users should be able to view inventory levels by product, category, and location.

2. **Automated Restocking Alerts:**  
   - Notifications should be sent automatically when stock levels fall below a predefined threshold.
   - Alerts should be configurable by product type and user role.

3. **Sales Trend Analysis:**  
   - The system should analyze historical sales data to predict future restocking needs.
   - Provide visual dashboards for sales trends and inventory forecasts.

4. **User Roles and Permissions:**  
   - Role-based access control for retail partners, supply chain team, and warehouse managers.
   - Admin users should have the ability to manage roles and permissions.

5. **Reporting and Analytics:**  
   - Generate reports on inventory levels, sales trends, and restocking recommendations.
   - Export reports in CSV, PDF, and Excel formats.

6. **Compliance and Auditability:**  
   - Ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA (if applicable), and PCI-DSS standards.
   - Implement audit trails for all critical system activities.

## **5. Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

### **5.1 Applicable Standards**
Based on the business requirements, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):**
   - **Applicability:** The system will handle personal data of users (e.g., names, emails, roles).
   - **Requirements:**
     - Obtain user consent for data collection and processing.
     - Provide users with the ability to access, modify, or delete their data.
     - Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
     - Implement data breach notification mechanisms.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Use encryption protocols (e.g., TLS for data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest).
     - Include a "Privacy Settings" section in the user interface for data access and deletion requests.
     - Maintain a log of data access and modifications for audit purposes.

2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):**
   - **Applicability:** If the system handles any health-related data (e.g., for products like medical supplies).
   - **Requirements:**
     - Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI).
     - Implement access controls and audit trails.
     - Encrypt sensitive data and ensure secure data transmission.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Use role-based access control to limit access to sensitive data.
     - Log all access to PHI and provide audit reports.
     - Conduct regular security risk assessments.

3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS):**
   - **Applicability:** If the system integrates with payment processing for inventory purchases.
   - **Requirements:**
     - Protect cardholder data through encryption and tokenization.
     - Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.
     - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Use a third-party PCI-compliant payment gateway for transactions.
     - Mask payment data in logs and reports.
     - Implement multi-factor authentication for users accessing payment data.

---

## **6. Security Measures**

### **6.1 Data Security**
- **Encryption:** Use AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **Access Control:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Data Masking:** Mask sensitive fields (e.g., passwords, payment data) in logs and reports.

### **6.2 System Security**
- **Authentication:** Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Conduct regular vulnerability scans and apply patches promptly.
- **Firewall and Intrusion Detection:** Deploy firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and block unauthorized access.

### **6.3 Audit Controls**
- Maintain an audit trail of all critical system activities, including:
  - User logins and logouts.
  - Data access, modifications, and deletions.
  - System configuration changes.
- Store audit logs securely and retain them for a minimum of 12 months.

---

## **7. Compliance Validation**

### **7.1 During Implementation**
- Conduct a compliance review at each development milestone.
- Perform security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
- Validate encryption mechanisms and access controls through code reviews.

### **7.2 Post-Implementation**
- Conduct a third-party compliance audit to ensure adherence to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS standards.
- Perform regular security assessments and update the system to address new threats.
- Monitor audit logs for suspicious activities and respond promptly to incidents.
