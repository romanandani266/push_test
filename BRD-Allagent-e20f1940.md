### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

### 13. **Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted:

#### **Applicable Regulations**
1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable as the system may handle personal data of users (e.g., usernames, emails) from the European Union.
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system integrates with payment systems for transactions.
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Not applicable as the system does not handle Protected Health Information (PHI).
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system collects personal data from California residents.
5. **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)**: Applicable for audit logging and financial data integrity if the system is used for financial reporting.

#### **Compliance Requirements and Implementation**

##### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- **Requirements**:
  - Data minimization: Collect only necessary personal data.
  - Consent: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
  - Right to access, rectify, and delete data.
  - Data encryption in transit and at rest.
  - Data breach notification within 72 hours.
- **Implementation**:
  - Ensure user data (e.g., email, username) is encrypted using AES-256 for data at rest and HTTPS for data in transit.
  - Provide a user interface for users to access, update, or delete their data.
  - Implement a consent management system for data collection.
  - Develop a data breach response plan and integrate it into the system.

##### **2. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**
- **Requirements**:
  - Secure storage of payment data (if applicable).
  - Regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
  - Role-based access control to limit access to sensitive data.
  - Audit logs for all access to payment data.
- **Implementation**:
  - If payment integration is added, use a PCI-compliant payment gateway.
  - Conduct quarterly vulnerability scans and annual penetration tests.
  - Implement role-based access control as outlined in the functional requirements.
  - Store audit logs in a secure, tamper-proof database.

##### **3. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**
- **Requirements**:
  - Provide users with the ability to opt-out of data collection.
  - Disclose the purpose of data collection and usage.
  - Allow users to request deletion of their data.
- **Implementation**:
  - Add an opt-out mechanism in the user interface.
  - Include a privacy policy detailing data collection and usage.
  - Extend the GDPR-compliant data access and deletion features to meet CCPA requirements.

##### **4. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)**
- **Requirements**:
  - Maintain accurate and tamper-proof audit logs.
  - Ensure financial data integrity.
  - Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized changes.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use the `Audit Logs` table to track all user actions, including data access and modifications.
  - Encrypt audit logs and store them in a secure database.
  - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users with access to financial data.

---

#### **Security Measures**
1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Use AES-256 for data at rest.
   - Use TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit.
2. **Access Control**:
   - Role-based access control as defined in the functional requirements.
   - Multi-factor authentication for all users.
3. **Vulnerability Management**:
   - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
   - Patch known vulnerabilities within 30 days of discovery.
4. **Incident Response**:
   - Develop and test an incident response plan.
   - Include procedures for data breach notification and mitigation.

---

#### **Data Privacy Rules**
1. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the data necessary for system functionality.
2. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
3. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain user data only as long as necessary for business purposes.
   - Automatically delete inactive user accounts after a predefined period (e.g., 2 years).
4. **Data Access**:
   - Allow users to access, update, or delete their data through the user interface.

---

#### **Audit Controls**
1. **Audit Logs**:
   - Track all user actions, including logins, data access, and modifications.
   - Store logs in a tamper-proof database.
2. **Log Retention**:
   - Retain audit logs for a minimum of 7 years to comply with SOX.
3. **Log Review**:
   - Conduct regular reviews of audit logs to identify suspicious activity.

---

#### **Validation of Compliance**

##### **During Implementation**
1. **Code Reviews**:
   - Conduct regular code reviews to ensure compliance with security and privacy standards.
2. **Automated Testing**:
   - Use automated tools to test for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
3. **Third-Party Audits**:
   - Engage a third-party auditor to validate compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other applicable standards.

##### **Post-Implementation**
1. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Conduct annual penetration tests to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
2. **Compliance Audits**:
   - Perform regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to regulatory standards.
3. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect user feedback to identify and address potential compliance gaps.
