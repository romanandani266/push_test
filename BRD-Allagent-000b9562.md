### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

## **Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System (RIMS) complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system must adhere to regulations such as **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, **PCI-DSS**, and other applicable standards based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed.

---

### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

#### **Applicability**
GDPR applies if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU). This includes user data such as `username`, `email`, and `password_hash`.

#### **Compliance Requirements**
1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
2. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data such as `password_hash` and `email`.
3. **Right to Access and Erasure**: Provide users with the ability to access, modify, and delete their personal data.
4. **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
5. **Data Retention Policy**: Define and enforce a policy for retaining and deleting user data.

#### **Implementation in RIMS**
- **Encryption**: Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for `password_hash` and encrypt sensitive fields like `email`.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to personal data.
- **Audit Logs**: Use the `Audit_Logs` table to track access and modifications to personal data.
- **Data Deletion**: Add functionality to delete user data upon request and ensure cascading deletions in related tables (e.g., `User_Activity`).

#### **Validation**
- Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
- Perform GDPR compliance audits during and after implementation.

### **2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

#### **Applicability**
HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). If RIMS does not handle PHI, this regulation may not be applicable.

#### **Compliance Requirements**
1. **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.
2. **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to sensitive data.
3. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

#### **Implementation in RIMS**
- **Access Control**: Use the `Users` table's `role` field to enforce RBAC.
- **Audit Logs**: Use the `Audit_Logs` table to track all access and modifications.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data fields and use HTTPS for data transmission.

#### **Validation**
- Conduct HIPAA compliance audits.
- Implement automated monitoring for unauthorized access.

---

### **3. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**

#### **Applicability**
PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information. If RIMS does not handle payment data, this regulation may not be applicable.

#### **Compliance Requirements**
1. **Secure Storage**: Do not store sensitive cardholder data unless absolutely necessary.
2. **Encryption**: Encrypt cardholder data using strong encryption methods.
3. **Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel only.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Track and monitor all access to cardholder data.

#### **Implementation in RIMS**
- **Secure Storage**: Avoid storing payment card information in the database.
- **Third-Party Integration**: Use PCI-compliant third-party payment processors.
- **Audit Logs**: Use the `Audit_Logs` table to track access to payment-related actions.

#### **Validation**
- Conduct PCI-DSS compliance audits.
- Use third-party tools to validate encryption and secure storage practices.

### **4. Security Measures**

#### **Data Security**
1. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data fields such as `password_hash` and `email`.
2. **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS for all data transmission.
3. **Access Control**: Implement RBAC using the `role` field in the `Users` table.
4. **Data Masking**: Mask sensitive data in logs and reports.

#### **System Security**
1. **Firewalls**: Use firewalls to protect the database and application servers.
2. **Intrusion Detection**: Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor for unauthorized access.
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep all software and dependencies up to date.

---

### **5. Data Privacy Rules**

1. **User Consent**: Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting their data.
2. **Data Anonymization**: Anonymize data used for analytics (e.g., `Sales_Trend` table).
3. **Data Retention**: Define retention periods for all data and enforce automatic deletion of expired data.

---

### **6. Audit Controls**

1. **Audit Logs**: Use the `Audit_Logs` table to track all user actions and system events.
2. **User Activity Tracking**: Use the `User_Activity` table to monitor user actions.
3. **Compliance Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

---

### **7. Validation During and After Implementation**

1. **Pre-Implementation**
   - Conduct a compliance gap analysis.
   - Perform security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
   - Validate database schema against compliance requirements.

2. **Post-Implementation**
   - Conduct regular compliance audits.
   - Monitor system logs for unauthorized access or anomalies.
   - Update policies and procedures based on audit findings.

---

### **8. Documentation Updates**

The database schema and system design must include the following updates to support compliance:
1. **Encryption**: Add encryption for sensitive fields in the database schema.
2. **Audit Logs**: Ensure the `Audit_Logs` table captures all necessary compliance-related events.
3. **Data Retention**: Define retention policies for each table and implement triggers to enforce them.

This updated BRD ensures that the Retail Inventory Management System (RIMS) complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, providing a secure and trustworthy platform for users and stakeholders.
