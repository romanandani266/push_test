### 15. **Technical Requirements**

#### **System Capabilities**
1. **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**:
   - Use WebSocket or RESTful APIs to fetch and update inventory data in real-time.
   - Support multi-location inventory tracking with location-specific data segregation.

2. **Automated Restocking Alerts**:
   - Implement a rule-based engine to trigger alerts when stock levels fall below predefined thresholds.
   - Use email and SMS APIs (e.g., Twilio) for notification delivery.

3. **Sales Trend Analysis**:
   - Integrate a data analytics module to process historical sales data.
   - Use libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data analysis and visualization tools like Chart.js or D3.js for graphical representation.

4. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Implement user authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Define user roles (e.g., Admin, Retail Partner, Warehouse Manager) with specific access permissions.

5. **Data Encryption**:
   - Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data storage.
   - Ensure HTTPS communication using SSL/TLS certificates.
