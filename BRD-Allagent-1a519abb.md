# Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Retail Inventory Management System

## Overview
The Retail Inventory Management System is designed to streamline inventory processes, enhance data integrity, and support business operations efficiently. This document outlines the business requirements, compliance standards, and technical specifications necessary for the successful implementation of the system.

## Business Requirements
1. **User Management**: The system must support different user roles such as retail partners, supply chain teams, and warehouse managers.
2. **Product Management**: Efficient handling of product information including creation, updates, and tracking.
3. **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time tracking of inventory levels across different locations.
4. **Alerts and Notifications**: Automated alerts for inventory thresholds to prevent stockouts or overstocking.
5. **Sales Trends Analysis**: Collection and analysis of sales data to identify trends and support decision-making.

## Compliance Standards
The system must comply with the following regulatory and compliance standards:

### 1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- **Compliance Requirements**:
  - Data Minimization: Only collect data necessary for the system's functionality.
  - Consent: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
  - Right to Access: Allow users to access their personal data.
  - Data Portability: Enable users to download their data in a structured format.
  - Right to Erasure: Provide users the ability to delete their personal data.

- **Implementation**:
  - Implement user consent forms and data access portals.
  - Design data export and deletion features.
  - Regularly audit data collection practices to ensure compliance.

### 2. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)
- **Compliance Requirements**:
  - Secure Storage: Encrypt cardholder data and sensitive authentication data.
  - Access Control: Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel only.
  - Regular Monitoring: Implement logging and monitoring of all access to network resources and cardholder data.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use encryption protocols for data storage and transmission.
  - Implement role-based access controls and regular access reviews.
  - Set up logging mechanisms and conduct regular security audits.

## Security Measures
- **Data Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data.
- **Access Controls**: Implement multi-factor authentication and role-based access controls.
- **Network Security**: Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to protect against unauthorized access.

## Data Privacy Rules
- **Data Anonymization**: Anonymize personal data where possible to protect user privacy.
- **Data Retention Policy**: Define and enforce data retention periods to minimize data storage.

## Audit Controls
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with GDPR and PCI-DSS.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed logs of data access and modifications for accountability.

## Compliance Validation
- **Pre-Implementation**: Conduct a compliance assessment to ensure all requirements are met before system deployment.
- **Post-Implementation**: Perform regular compliance checks and audits to ensure ongoing adherence to regulatory standards.

This BRD ensures that the Retail Inventory Management System not only meets business and technical requirements but also adheres to necessary compliance standards, thereby safeguarding data privacy and security.
