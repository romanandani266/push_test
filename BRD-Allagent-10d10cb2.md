# Project Requirements

# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

## Project Name
Retail Inventory Management System (RIMS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The retail industry faces challenges in managing inventory efficiently, leading to overstocking, understocking, and waste. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a simple and efficient retail inventory management system. The system will track product stock levels in real-time, predict restocking needs, and minimize waste, thereby improving operational efficiency and reducing costs.

### 1.2 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the business, technical, and compliance requirements for the development of a retail inventory management system. It serves as a guide for all stakeholders involved in the project, ensuring alignment on objectives, scope, deliverables, and regulatory compliance.

## 2. Business Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a retail inventory management system that:
- Tracks product stock levels in real-time.
- Predicts restocking needs based on sales trends and inventory data.
- Minimizes waste by optimizing inventory levels.
- Ensures compliance with relevant regulatory and data protection standards.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In-Scope
The project will include the following:
- Development of a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Implementation of automated stock alert notifications.
- Integration of sales trend analysis for predictive restocking.
- Role-based access control for different user groups (e.g., retail partners, supply chain team, warehouse managers).
- Implementation of compliance measures for data security and privacy.

### 3.2 Out-of-Scope
- Mobile application development.
- Integration with third-party logistics systems.
- Advanced AI/ML models for demand forecasting (beyond basic sales trend analysis).

## 5. Compliance and Regulatory Standards

### 5.1 Applicable Regulations
Based on the business requirements and the nature of the system, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
   - **Applicability**: The system will handle personal data of users (e.g., usernames, roles, and potentially sensitive information). GDPR applies if the system is used in the European Union or involves EU citizens.
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Data minimization: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
     - User consent: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
     - Right to access and delete: Allow users to access and delete their personal data.
     - Data encryption: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
     - Breach notification: Notify relevant authorities and affected users in case of a data breach.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use encryption protocols (e.g., TLS for data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest).
     - Implement a consent management system for user data.
     - Provide a user interface for data access and deletion requests.
     - Set up automated breach detection and notification mechanisms.

2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**  
   - **Applicability**: If the system integrates with payment processing for inventory purchases or sales.
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Secure storage of payment data.
     - Regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
     - Role-based access control to limit access to payment data.
     - Logging and monitoring of all access to payment data.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use tokenization for payment data storage.
     - Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans.
     - Implement detailed logging and monitoring for payment-related activities.

3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**  
   - **Applicability**: If the system is used in a healthcare retail setting (e.g., pharmacies) and handles Protected Health Information (PHI).
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI.
     - Implement access controls and audit trails.
     - Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.
     - Conduct regular risk assessments.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use HIPAA-compliant cloud services for data storage.
     - Implement audit logging for all access to PHI.
     - Conduct regular risk assessments and update security measures accordingly.

4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**  
   - **Applicability**: If the system is used in California or involves California residents.
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - Provide transparency about data collection and usage.
     - Allow users to opt out of data sharing.
     - Enable users to request deletion of their data.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Include a privacy policy detailing data collection and usage.
     - Provide an opt-out mechanism for data sharing.
     - Implement a user interface for data deletion requests.

## 6. Security Measures

### 6.1 Data Security
- **Encryption**: Use TLS for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Authentication**: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative users.
- **Data Masking**: Mask sensitive data in logs and reports.

### 6.2 Network Security
- **Firewalls**: Deploy firewalls to protect the system from unauthorized access.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor and respond to potential threats.
- **VPN**: Require VPN access for remote connections to the system.

### 6.3 Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
- **Secure APIs**: Use API gateways and secure API keys for external integrations.
- **Patch Management**: Regularly update software and dependencies to address vulnerabilities.

---

## 7. Data Privacy Rules

- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
- **User Consent**: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
- **Data Retention**: Define and enforce data retention policies to delete data that is no longer needed.
- **Anonymization**: Anonymize data used for analytics to protect user privacy.

---

## 8. Audit Controls

- **Logging**: Log all user activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
- **Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed audit trails for all data access and changes.
- **Compliance Audits**: Conduct regular compliance audits to ensure adherence to regulatory standards.

## 9. Compliance Validation

### 9.1 During Implementation
- Conduct a compliance gap analysis to identify and address potential issues.
- Perform security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scans.
