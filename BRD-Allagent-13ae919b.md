# Project Requirements

# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
The **Retail Inventory Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline inventory management for retail partners, the PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers. The system aims to provide real-time tracking of product stock levels, predict restocking needs, and minimize waste through automated alerts and sales trend analysis.

## 2. Compliance and Regulatory Standards

### Overview
To ensure the system complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following regulations have been identified as applicable based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the collection and processing of personal data of users (e.g., retail partners, warehouse managers).
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system processes payment information for sales transactions.
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Not applicable unless the system processes health-related data.
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system collects personal data of California residents.

### 3. Compliance Requirements and Implementation

#### 3.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
**Key Requirements**:
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect data necessary for the system's functionality.
- **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
- **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
- **Data Security**: Implement measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Notify authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Minimization**: Limit user data collection to `name`, `email`, and `role`. Avoid collecting sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.
- **Consent Management**: Add a consent form during user registration, clearly outlining data usage.
- **Right to Access and Erasure**: Provide a user interface for users to view and delete their data.
- **Data Security**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., `password_hash`) using industry-standard algorithms. Use HTTPS for all data transmissions.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Implement a monitoring system to detect breaches and automate notifications.

#### 3.2 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)
**Key Requirements**:
- **Secure Storage**: Do not store sensitive payment information unless necessary. If stored, encrypt it.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.
- **Network Security**: Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to protect the network.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to ensure compliance.

**Implementation**:
- **Secure Storage**: Avoid storing payment data in the system. Use third-party payment processors that are PCI-DSS compliant.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Network Security**: Use firewalls and secure VPNs for network communication.
- **Regular Audits**: Schedule quarterly security audits and vulnerability assessments.

#### 3.3 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
**Key Requirements**:
- **Data Transparency**: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
- **Opt-Out Option**: Allow users to opt out of data collection and sale.
- **Right to Access and Deletion**: Provide users with access to their data and the ability to delete it.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Transparency**: Include a privacy policy detailing data collection practices.
- **Opt-Out Option**: Add an opt-out mechanism in the user settings.
- **Right to Access and Deletion**: Extend the GDPR-compliant access and deletion features to meet CCPA requirements.

### 4. Security Measures

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive fields such as `password_hash` using SHA-256 or bcrypt.
   - Use TLS/SSL for all data transmissions.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement RBAC to restrict access based on user roles (`retail_partner`, `warehouse_manager`, `supply_chain_team`).
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Maintain logs of all user activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
   - Store logs securely and retain them for at least 1 year.

4. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain sales data for 5 years and alerts for 1 year after deactivation.
   - Automatically delete user data upon account deletion or after the retention period.

5. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Perform daily backups of the database.
   - Store weekly full backups in a secure cloud location with encryption.

---

### 5. Data Privacy Rules

1. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection during registration.
   - Provide an option to withdraw consent at any time.

2. **Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize data used for analytics to prevent identification of individuals.

3. **Data Sharing**:
   - Do not share user data with third parties without explicit consent.

4. **Data Access**:
   - Allow users to view, update, and delete their personal data through the user interface.

---

### 6. Audit Controls

1. **Internal Audits**:
   - Conduct monthly internal audits to ensure compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.
   - Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

2. **External Audits**:
   - Engage third-party auditors annually to validate compliance with PCI-DSS and GDPR.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Use monitoring tools to track system performance and detect anomalies.
   - Set up alerts for unauthorized access attempts and data breaches.

---

### 7. Compliance Validation

#### During Implementation:
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct code reviews to ensure encryption and access control mechanisms are implemented correctly.
- **Penetration Testing**: Perform penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance Checklists**: Use checklists for GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA to verify compliance.

#### After Implementation:
- **User Testing**: Allow users to test the system and provide feedback on data access and privacy features.
- **Regular Audits**: Schedule regular internal and external audits to maintain compliance.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and test an incident response plan for data breaches.

This updated BRD ensures that the **Retail Inventory Management System** is not only robust and scalable but also compliant with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards.
