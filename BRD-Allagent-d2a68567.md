### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

## **9. Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis and measures have been incorporated:

---

### **9.1 Applicable Compliance Standards**

Based on the business requirements and the nature of the system, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
   - **Applicability:** The system will handle personal data of users (e.g., names, emails, and roles). GDPR applies if the system is used by businesses operating in the European Union (EU) or serving EU customers.
   - **Key Requirements:**
     - **Data Minimization:** Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
     - **Consent Management:** Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
     - **Right to Access and Erasure:** Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
     - **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
     - **Data Breach Notification:** Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
   - **Implementation Measures:**
     - Encrypt user data (e.g., passwords) using algorithms like bcrypt.
     - Implement a consent management module for user registration.
     - Provide API endpoints for users to access and delete their data.
     - Log and monitor system activities to detect and respond to breaches promptly.

2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**  
   - **Applicability:** If the system integrates with payment processing in future phases, PCI-DSS compliance will be required.
   - **Key Requirements:**
     - **Secure Payment Data:** Encrypt payment information and ensure secure transmission.
     - **Access Control:** Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.
     - **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans.
   - **Implementation Measures:**  
     - Although payment processing is out of scope for this phase, the system will be designed to integrate securely with PCI-compliant payment gateways in the future.

3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**  
   - **Applicability:** Not applicable unless the system handles Protected Health Information (PHI), which is not within the current scope.

4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**  
   - **Applicability:** If the system is used by businesses operating in California or serving California residents.
   - **Key Requirements:**
     - **Data Transparency:** Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
     - **Opt-Out Option:** Allow users to opt out of data sharing with third parties.
     - **Data Deletion:** Provide users with the ability to request data deletion.
   - **Implementation Measures:**
     - Include a privacy policy outlining data collection and usage.
     - Provide an opt-out mechanism for data sharing.
     - Implement API endpoints for data deletion requests.

---

### **9.2 Security Measures**

To comply with the above standards and ensure the system's security, the following measures will be implemented:

1. **Data Encryption:**
   - Use TLS (Transport Layer Security) for encrypting data in transit.
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords) using bcrypt or similar algorithms.

2. **Access Control:**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities.
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.

3. **Audit Logs:**
   - Maintain detailed logs of system activities, including user logins, data access, and changes to critical records.
   - Store logs in a secure, tamper-proof format.

4. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - Conduct periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
   - Update dependencies and libraries to address known vulnerabilities.

5. **Data Backup and Recovery:**
   - Implement automated backups with encryption.
   - Test recovery procedures regularly to ensure data integrity.

---

### **9.3 Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Minimization:**
   - Only collect data necessary for system functionality (e.g., user authentication, inventory tracking).

2. **User Consent:**
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection during user registration.
   - Provide users with a clear privacy policy.

3. **Data Retention:**
   - Define a data retention policy to delete inactive user accounts and outdated records after a specified period.

4. **Anonymization:**
   - Anonymize data used for analytics to prevent identification of individual users.

---

### **9.4 Audit Controls**

1. **System Logs Table:**
   - The `System Logs` table will store detailed logs of system activities, including:
     - User logins and logouts.
     - Data access and modifications.
     - System errors and warnings.

2. **Audit Trail:**
   - Maintain an audit trail for critical actions, such as changes to user roles, product thresholds, and stock levels.

3. **Compliance Monitoring:**
   - Use automated tools to monitor compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable standards.
   - Generate compliance reports for internal and external audits.

---

### **9.5 Validation of Compliance**

1. **During Implementation:**
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure compliance with data privacy and security standards.
   - Perform unit and integration testing for features like data encryption, access control, and audit logging.

2. **Post-Implementation:**
   - Conduct a third-party security audit to validate compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other standards.
   - Monitor system logs and alerts for potential breaches or non-compliance issues.
   - Provide training to system administrators and users on compliance requirements.

3. **Ongoing Validation:**
   - Schedule regular compliance audits (e.g., annually).
   - Update the system to address changes in regulatory requirements.

---

### **9.6 Documentation Updates**

The following updates will be made to the BRD to reflect compliance requirements:
- Add a section on compliance standards and their applicability.
- Include security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls in the technical requirements.
- Document the process for validating compliance during and after implementation.
