# Project Requirements

To ensure the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following section will be added to the Business Requirements Document (BRD). This section outlines the applicable compliance standards, their requirements, and how the system will meet them. Additionally, it specifies the security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls that must be incorporated into the solution, along with instructions for validating compliance during and after implementation.

## 13. Regulatory and Compliance Standards

### 13.1 Applicable Compliance Standards
Based on the business requirements and the nature of the system, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the collection and processing of personal data (e.g., user email addresses, roles, and audit logs).
2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Applicable if the system processes or stores Protected Health Information (PHI).
3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system processes or stores payment card information.
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system serves users in California and processes personal data.

### 13.2 Compliance Requirements and Implementation

#### 1. **GDPR Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
     - Ensure the right to access, rectify, and delete personal data.
     - Implement data minimization and pseudonymization techniques.
     - Notify users of data breaches within 72 hours.
     - Maintain records of processing activities.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Add a consent mechanism during user registration.
     - Provide a user interface for managing personal data (e.g., view, update, delete).
     - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., `password_hash`) and use pseudonymization for audit logs.
     - Implement a breach notification system integrated with the `Notifications` table.
     - Maintain an audit trail in the `Audit Logs` table for all data processing activities.

#### 2. **HIPAA Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI.
     - Implement access controls and audit trails.
     - Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.
     - Conduct regular risk assessments and employee training.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use the `Roles` table to enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
     - Log all access and modifications to PHI in the `Audit Logs` table.
     - Encrypt all sensitive data fields in the database.
     - Schedule regular security audits and penetration testing.

#### 3. **PCI-DSS Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Protect cardholder data through encryption and secure storage.
     - Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis.
     - Regularly test security systems and processes.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Store payment card information in a separate, encrypted database (if applicable).
     - Use the `Roles` table to restrict access to payment data.
     - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.

#### 4. **CCPA Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Provide users with the right to know what personal data is collected and how it is used.
     - Allow users to opt out of data selling.
     - Delete personal data upon user request.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Add a privacy policy page detailing data collection and usage.
     - Provide an opt-out mechanism for data sharing.
     - Implement a data deletion feature integrated with the `Users` table.

### 13.3 Security Measures
To ensure compliance with the above standards, the following security measures will be implemented:
1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive fields such as `password_hash`, PHI, and payment data.
   - Use TLS for all data transmitted over the network.
2. **Access Controls**:
   - Enforce RBAC using the `Roles` table.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.
3. **Audit Trails**:
   - Log all critical actions (e.g., data access, updates, deletions) in the `Audit Logs` table.
   - Include user ID, action, and timestamp in each log entry.
4. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the data necessary for system functionality.
   - Use pseudonymization for non-essential data in audit logs.

---

### 13.4 Data Privacy Rules
1. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection during registration.
   - Allow users to withdraw consent at any time.
2. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain personal data only as long as necessary for business purposes.
   - Automatically delete inactive user accounts after a specified period.
3. **Data Access**:
   - Allow users to view, update, and delete their personal data through a self-service portal.

---

### 13.5 Audit Controls
1. **Audit Log Triggers**:
   - Automatically log all changes to critical tables (e.g., `Users`, `Products`, `Sales`) using triggers.
2. **Regular Audits**:
   - Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.
3. **Breach Detection**:
   - Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify potential data breaches.

---

### 13.6 Compliance Validation
1. **During Implementation**:
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure encryption and access controls are implemented correctly.
   - Perform unit and integration testing for compliance-related features (e.g., consent mechanism, data deletion).
2. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Schedule regular compliance audits by an external auditor.
   - Use automated tools to monitor compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.
   - Maintain a compliance dashboard for real-time monitoring.
