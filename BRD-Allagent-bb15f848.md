# Project Requirements

### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

## **7. Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

### **7.1 Overview**
To ensure the retail inventory management system complies with relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following regulations have been identified as applicable based on the business requirements and the nature of the system:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the potential handling of user data (e.g., usernames, roles, and authentication details).
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Not applicable as the system does not handle payment or credit card information.
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Not applicable as the system does not process or store protected health information (PHI).
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system is used by businesses operating in California and meets the CCPA thresholds for data collection.

### **7.2 Compliance Requirements**

#### **7.2.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
**Key Requirements:**
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the system's functionality.
- **Data Security**: Implement measures to protect user data from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks.
- **User Rights**: Provide users with the ability to access, modify, or delete their personal data.
- **Data Retention**: Define and enforce policies for data retention and deletion.
- **Auditability**: Maintain logs of data access and modifications for auditing purposes.

**Implementation in the System:**
- **Data Minimization**: Limit user data collection to `username`, `password_hash`, and `role`.
- **Data Security**:
  - Use encryption (e.g., AES-256) for sensitive data like `password_hash`.
  - Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission.
  - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **User Rights**:
  - Provide a user interface for users to view and update their data.
  - Implement a "Delete Account" feature to allow users to remove their data.
- **Data Retention**:
  - Define a policy to delete inactive user accounts after a specified period (e.g., 2 years).
- **Auditability**:
  - Log all user actions (e.g., login, data updates) in a secure audit table.

#### **7.2.2 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**
**Key Requirements:**
- **Right to Know**: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
- **Right to Delete**: Allow users to request the deletion of their data.
- **Right to Opt-Out**: Provide users with the ability to opt out of data sharing.
- **Data Security**: Protect user data from unauthorized access or breaches.

**Implementation in the System:**
- **Right to Know**:
  - Include a privacy policy detailing the data collected and its purpose.
  - Display a consent banner for data collection at the time of user registration.
- **Right to Delete**:
  - Implement a feature for users to request data deletion.
  - Ensure data deletion requests are processed within 30 days.
- **Right to Opt-Out**:
  - Provide an option for users to opt out of non-essential data collection (e.g., analytics).
- **Data Security**:
  - Follow the same security measures outlined under GDPR.

### **7.3 Security Measures**

To comply with GDPR and CCPA, the following security measures will be incorporated into the system:

1. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., `password_hash`) using industry-standard algorithms.
   - Use SSL/TLS for secure communication between the client and server.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.

3. **Data Masking**:
   - Mask sensitive data in logs and reports to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct periodic security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

5. **Incident Response Plan**:
   - Develop and document an incident response plan to handle data breaches.

### **7.4 Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect only the data necessary for system functionality.
   - Obtain user consent before collecting personal data.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Store data in a secure PostgreSQL database with access controls.
   - Use database encryption for sensitive fields.

3. **Data Sharing**:
   - Do not share user data with third parties without explicit consent.

4. **Data Retention**:
   - Define and enforce a data retention policy.
   - Automatically delete inactive user accounts after a specified period.

---

### **7.5 Audit Controls**

1. **Audit Logs**:
   - Maintain logs of all user actions, including login attempts, data updates, and report generation.
   - Store logs in a secure, tamper-proof format.

2. **Access Monitoring**:
   - Monitor and log access to sensitive data.
   - Generate alerts for unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Periodic Reviews**:
   - Conduct regular reviews of audit logs to identify suspicious activities.

---

### **7.6 Compliance Validation**

#### **During Implementation**:
1. **Code Reviews**:
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure compliance with GDPR and CCPA requirements.
2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Perform penetration testing to identify and address security vulnerabilities.
3. **Data Flow Analysis**:
   - Analyze data flows to ensure compliance with data minimization and security requirements.

#### **Post-Implementation**:
1. **Compliance Audits**:
   - Conduct regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to GDPR and CCPA.
2. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect user feedback on data privacy features and address any concerns.
3. **Incident Reporting**:
   - Monitor and report any data breaches or incidents as required by GDPR and CCPA.

---

### **7.7 Documentation Updates**

The following updates will be made to the BRD to reflect compliance requirements:
1. Add a "Compliance and Regulatory Standards" section (this section).
2. Update the "Functional Requirements" section to include features for user data management (e.g., data access, deletion).
3. Include compliance validation steps in the project timeline.
