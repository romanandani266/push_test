### 18. **Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system will adhere to the following regulations based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed:

---

#### **Applicable Compliance Standards**

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
   - **Applicability:** The system will handle personal data of users (e.g., email addresses, usernames, and roles) and may be used in regions where GDPR is enforced.  
   - **Compliance Requirements:**  
     - **Data Minimization:** Collect only the data necessary for the system's functionality.  
     - **Consent Management:** Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.  
     - **Right to Access and Erasure:** Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.  
     - **Data Breach Notification:** Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.  
     - **Data Encryption:** Encrypt all personal data both in transit and at rest.  
   - **Implementation in the System:**  
     - Implement a consent management module during user registration.  
     - Provide a user interface for accessing and deleting personal data.  
     - Use HTTPS for secure data transmission and AES-256 encryption for data storage.  
     - Set up automated alerts for potential data breaches.  

2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**  
   - **Applicability:** Not applicable, as the system does not process or store Protected Health Information (PHI).  

3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**  
   - **Applicability:** Not applicable, as the system does not handle payment card information.  

4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**  
   - **Applicability:** If the system is used in California, it must comply with CCPA for data privacy.  
   - **Compliance Requirements:**  
     - **Right to Know:** Allow users to know what personal data is being collected and how it is used.  
     - **Right to Delete:** Provide users the ability to delete their personal data.  
     - **Opt-Out of Data Sale:** Ensure users can opt out of the sale of their personal data (if applicable).  
   - **Implementation in the System:**  
     - Include a privacy policy detailing data collection and usage.  
     - Provide a user interface for data deletion requests.  
     - Ensure no user data is sold to third parties.  

5. **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)**  
   - **Applicability:** Relevant for audit logs and financial data integrity.  
   - **Compliance Requirements:**  
     - Maintain detailed audit logs of all system activities.  
     - Ensure logs are tamper-proof and retained for a specified period.  
   - **Implementation in the System:**  
     - Use a secure, append-only database for audit logs.  
     - Retain logs for a minimum of 7 years.  

---

#### **Security Measures**

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
   - Ensure users can only access data and functionalities relevant to their roles.  
   - Implement least privilege principles to minimize access to sensitive data.  

2. **Data Encryption:**  
   - Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.  
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption.  

3. **Authentication and Authorization:**  
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.  
   - Use secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).  

4. **Data Backup and Disaster Recovery:**  
   - Schedule regular backups of the database.  
   - Implement disaster recovery mechanisms on AWS Cloud hosting.  

5. **Vulnerability Management:**  
   - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.  
   - Apply security patches and updates promptly.  

---

#### **Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Retention Policy:**  
   - Retain user data only as long as necessary for business operations.  
   - Automatically delete inactive user accounts after a specified period (e.g., 2 years).  

2. **Anonymization:**  
   - Anonymize data used for analytics to prevent identification of individuals.  

3. **User Consent:**  
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing during user registration.  

4. **Data Access Requests:**  
   - Provide a mechanism for users to request access to their data.  

---

#### **Audit Controls**

1. **Audit Log Requirements:**  
   - Log all user actions, including login attempts, data modifications, and system configuration changes.  
   - Include timestamps, user IDs, and action details in the logs.  

2. **Log Retention:**  
   - Retain audit logs for a minimum of 7 years to comply with SOX requirements.  

3. **Log Security:**  
   - Store logs in a secure, tamper-proof database.  
   - Restrict access to logs to authorized personnel only.  

---

#### **Validation of Compliance**

1. **During Implementation:**  
   - Conduct regular code reviews to ensure compliance with security and privacy standards.  
   - Perform data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) to identify and mitigate risks.  
   - Test the system for GDPR and CCPA compliance using automated tools.  

2. **Post-Implementation:**  
   - Schedule periodic compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to regulations.  
   - Monitor system logs for unauthorized access or suspicious activities.  
   - Update the system to comply with new or updated regulations.
