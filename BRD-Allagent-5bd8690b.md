# Project Requirements

### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

### 20. **Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

To ensure the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The applicable standards are identified based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed. For each regulation, compliance requirements are outlined, and the measures to meet them are specified.

---

#### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

**Applicability**: GDPR applies as the system may process personal data of users (e.g., usernames, hashed passwords) and potentially customer data if extended to include customer-facing functionalities.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's operation.
- **Data Security**: Implement strong encryption for sensitive data (e.g., hashed passwords) and secure data transmission (e.g., HTTPS).
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to personal data based on user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Viewer).
- **Right to Access and Erasure**: Provide mechanisms to allow users to access and delete their data upon request.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.

**Implementation Measures**:
- Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) for sensitive data storage.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to personal data.
- Develop APIs to handle user data access and deletion requests.
- Set up monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to data breaches.

**Validation**:
- Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
- Perform audits to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.
- Maintain documentation of data processing activities.

#### **2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

**Applicability**: HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). While the current scope does not include PHI, future extensions may require compliance.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access PHI.
- **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that PHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

**Implementation Measures**:
- Use HIPAA-compliant cloud services for data storage and processing.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing sensitive data.
- Develop audit logging mechanisms to track access and changes to PHI.

**Validation**:
- Conduct HIPAA compliance audits.
- Use third-party tools to validate encryption and access control mechanisms.
- Train staff on HIPAA compliance requirements.

#### **3. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**

**Applicability**: PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information. While the current scope does not include payment processing, future integrations may require compliance.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt cardholder data during storage and transmission.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel only.
- **Network Security**: Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to protect the network.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly update and patch systems to address vulnerabilities.

**Implementation Measures**:
- Use tokenization to replace sensitive cardholder data with non-sensitive tokens.
- Implement secure payment gateways for processing transactions.
- Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.

**Validation**:
- Obtain PCI-DSS certification through a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).
- Perform regular compliance checks and audits.
- Maintain detailed documentation of security measures.

#### **4. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**

**Applicability**: CCPA applies if the system processes personal data of California residents and meets certain thresholds (e.g., annual revenue, number of users).

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Data Transparency**: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
- **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Provide users with the ability to opt out of data collection and sharing.
- **Data Access and Deletion**: Allow users to access and delete their personal data.

**Implementation Measures**:
- Update the privacy policy to include CCPA-specific disclosures.
- Develop APIs to handle data access, deletion, and opt-out requests.
- Implement mechanisms to track and honor user preferences.

**Validation**:
- Conduct CCPA compliance audits.
- Use third-party tools to verify data access and deletion mechanisms.
- Train staff on CCPA requirements.

### 21. **Security Measures**

To ensure compliance with the above regulations, the following security measures will be incorporated into the solution:

1. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, personal data) using industry-standard algorithms.
   - Use HTTPS for all data transmissions.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Maintain logs of all access and modifications to sensitive data.
   - Use centralized logging systems for monitoring and analysis.

4. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize personal data where possible to reduce compliance risks.

5. **Regular Updates**:
   - Apply security patches and updates to all software components regularly.

### 22. **Data Privacy Rules**

The following data privacy rules will be enforced:

1. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the system's purpose.
   - Implement automated data deletion mechanisms for expired data.

2. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting their data.
   - Provide clear and concise information about data usage.

3. **Data Sharing**:
   - Restrict data sharing to authorized parties only.
   - Use data-sharing agreements to ensure third-party compliance.

---

### 23. **Audit Controls**

The following audit controls will be implemented:

1. **Access Logs**:
   - Log all access to sensitive data, including user ID, timestamp, and action performed.

2. **Change Logs**:
   - Maintain logs of all changes to sensitive data, including the old and new values.

3. **Audit Trails**:
   - Use audit trails to track system activities and detect anomalies.

4. **Regular Audits**:
   - Conduct regular internal and external audits to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

---

### 24. **Compliance Validation**

Compliance will be validated during and after implementation through the following steps:

1. **Pre-Implementation**:
   - Conduct a compliance gap analysis to identify and address potential issues.
   - Develop a compliance checklist based on the applicable regulations.

2. **During Implementation**:
   - Perform regular code reviews to ensure compliance with security and privacy requirements.
   - Use automated tools to validate encryption, access control, and logging mechanisms.

3. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Conduct third-party audits to verify compliance with regulatory standards.
   - Monitor system activities to detect and address compliance violations.
