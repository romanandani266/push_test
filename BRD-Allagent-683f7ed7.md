### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

### 18. **Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system will adhere to the applicable standards based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed.

---

#### **Applicable Compliance Standards**

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
   - **Applicability**: GDPR applies as the system may handle personal data of users (e.g., usernames, email addresses) and potentially customers if integrated with customer-facing systems.  
   - **Key Compliance Requirements**:
     - **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
     - **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
     - **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
     - **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
     - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
   - **Implementation in the System**:
     - Encrypt sensitive fields like `password_hash` and `email` in the `Users` table.
     - Implement a user interface for data access and deletion requests.
     - Log and monitor access to personal data in the `Audit Logs` table.
     - Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for data transmission.
     - Add a consent management module for user agreements.

2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**  
   - **Applicability**: HIPAA is not directly applicable unless the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). If integrated with healthcare-related data, compliance will be required.  
   - **Key Compliance Requirements** (if applicable):
     - **Access Controls**: Restrict access to PHI based on user roles.
     - **Audit Controls**: Maintain detailed logs of all access and modifications to PHI.
     - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.
     - **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
   - **Implementation in the System**:
     - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the `role` field in the `Users` table.
     - Use the `Audit Logs` table to track access and modifications to sensitive data.
     - Encrypt all sensitive data fields.

3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**  
   - **Applicability**: PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information.  
   - **Key Compliance Requirements**:
     - **Secure Storage**: Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization.
     - **Access Restrictions**: Limit access to cardholder data to authorized personnel.
     - **Encryption**: Encrypt cardholder data during transmission and storage.
     - **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly test and monitor the system for vulnerabilities.
   - **Implementation in the System**:
     - Avoid storing payment card information in the database.
     - Use third-party payment processors that are PCI-DSS compliant.
     - Implement regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.

4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**  
   - **Applicability**: CCPA applies if the system handles personal data of California residents.  
   - **Key Compliance Requirements**:
     - **Data Access and Deletion**: Allow users to access and delete their personal data.
     - **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Provide users with the ability to opt out of data sharing.
     - **Data Disclosure**: Inform users about the categories of data collected and its purpose.
   - **Implementation in the System**:
     - Add a user interface for data access, deletion, and opt-out requests.
     - Include a privacy policy outlining data collection and usage practices.

---

#### **Security Measures**

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data fields (e.g., `password_hash`, `email`) in the `Users` table.
   - Use TLS/SSL for secure data transmission.

2. **Access Controls**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the `role` field in the `Users` table.
   - Restrict access to sensitive tables (e.g., `Audit Logs`, `Inventory Transactions`) based on user roles.

3. **Audit Controls**:
   - Use the `Audit Logs` table to track all system activities, including data access, modifications, and deletions.
   - Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activities.

4. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize personal data in the `Audit Logs` table to protect user privacy.

5. **Vulnerability Management**:
   - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
   - Apply security patches and updates promptly.

---

#### **Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain personal data only as long as necessary for the system's functionality.
   - Implement automated data deletion policies for inactive accounts.

2. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the data required for the system's operations.
   - Avoid storing sensitive data like payment card information.

3. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
   - Provide users with a clear and concise privacy policy.

---

#### **Audit Controls**

1. **Logging**:
   - Log all user activities, including logins, data access, and modifications, in the `Audit Logs` table.
   - Include details such as `user_id`, `action`, `details`, and `timestamp`.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement real-time monitoring of audit logs for suspicious activities.
   - Use automated alerts for unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Review**:
   - Conduct regular reviews of audit logs to identify and address potential security issues.

---

#### **Compliance Validation**

1. **During Implementation**:
   - Conduct a compliance audit to ensure all regulatory requirements are met.
   - Perform security testing, including vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
   - Validate data encryption and access controls.

2. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Schedule regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to regulatory standards.
   - Monitor system activities using the `Audit Logs` table.
   - Update the system to address new regulatory requirements or security threats.
