# Project Requirements

### **Security Measures**

To meet the compliance requirements, the following security measures will be implemented:

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive fields such as `password` in the `Users` table.
   - Use TLS for secure data transmission.

2. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Use the `Roles` table to define and enforce access levels for different user roles.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Maintain logs of all data access and modifications in a secure, tamper-proof format.

4. **Data Backup and Recovery**:
   - Implement automated daily backups of the database.
   - Test recovery procedures regularly to ensure data integrity.

5. **Vulnerability Management**:
   - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
   - Apply security patches and updates promptly.

6. **Data Breach Response Plan**:
   - Establish a plan to detect, respond to, and notify stakeholders of data breaches.

### **Audit Controls**

1. **Access Logs**:
   - Log all access to sensitive data, including the user ID, timestamp, and action performed.

2. **Modification Logs**:
   - Log all modifications to sensitive data, including the old and new values.

3. **Compliance Audits**:
   - Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

---

### **Validation of Compliance**

#### **During Implementation**:
1. **Code Reviews**:
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure that encryption, access control, and logging mechanisms are implemented correctly.

2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Perform penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

3. **Compliance Checklists**:
   - Use checklists to verify that all compliance requirements are met.

#### **After Implementation**:
1. **Regular Audits**:
   - Conduct regular audits to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory standards.

2. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Implement monitoring tools to detect and respond to security incidents.

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect feedback from users to identify and address privacy concerns.

### **Integration with Database Schema**

The compliance and security measures will be integrated into the database schema as follows:

1. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive fields such as `password` in the `Users` table.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Use the `Roles` table to enforce role-based access control.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Add a new `AuditLogs` table to store logs of data access and modifications.

#### **AuditLogs Table**
- **Purpose**: Stores logs of data access and modifications for compliance and accountability.
- **Fields**:
  - `log_id` (Primary Key, Integer, Auto-increment)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key, Integer, References `Users.user_id`)
  - `action` (String, Not Null)
  - `timestamp` (Timestamp, Default: Current Timestamp)
  - `details` (String, Nullable)
