### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

### 17. **Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system will adhere to the following regulations based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed:

---

#### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

**Applicability**: GDPR applies as the system may process personal data of users (e.g., email addresses, usernames, and roles) and potentially customer data if integrated with ERP systems.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
- **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
- **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
- **Data Protection by Design**: Incorporate privacy measures into the system's architecture.

**Implementation**:
- Implement a **privacy policy** and ensure users consent to it during registration.
- Provide a **user portal** for accessing and managing personal data.
- Use **encryption (AES-256)** for data at rest and **TLS/HTTPS** for data in transit.
- Maintain **audit logs** to track data access and modifications.
- Configure **AWS security features** (e.g., encryption, IAM roles) to protect data.

**Validation**:
- Conduct **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)** during development.
- Perform **penetration testing** and **vulnerability assessments**.
- Regularly review and update the privacy policy.

---

#### **2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

**Applicability**: HIPAA is not directly applicable unless the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). However, if the system is later extended to handle healthcare-related inventory, HIPAA compliance will be required.

**Compliance Requirements** (if applicable in the future):
- **Access Control**: Implement strict role-based access to PHI.
- **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.
- **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Ensure third-party vendors comply with HIPAA.

**Implementation**:
- Not applicable in the current scope but can be incorporated in future iterations.

**Validation**:
- Conduct **HIPAA compliance audits** if the scope changes.

---

#### **3. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**

**Applicability**: PCI-DSS is not applicable as the system does not process payment card information.

---

#### **4. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**

**Applicability**: CCPA applies if the system processes personal data of California residents and meets the thresholds for applicability (e.g., annual revenue, data volume).

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Right to Know**: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
- **Right to Delete**: Allow users to request deletion of their data.
- **Opt-Out of Sale**: Provide an option to opt-out of data sharing for commercial purposes.
- **Data Security**: Implement reasonable security measures to protect personal data.

**Implementation**:
- Include a **CCPA-compliant privacy policy**.
- Provide a **data request portal** for users to exercise their rights.
- Ensure **data anonymization** for analytics purposes.

**Validation**:
- Conduct **CCPA compliance reviews**.
- Perform **data mapping** to ensure all personal data is accounted for.

---

#### **5. Industry-Specific Standards**

**Applicability**: The system must comply with any industry-specific standards relevant to retail and supply chain management.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure accurate and reliable inventory data.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs of all inventory changes for accountability.
- **System Availability**: Meet the uptime requirement of 99.9% or higher.

**Implementation**:
- Use **PostgreSQL** for reliable data storage and integrity.
- Implement **AWS failover mechanisms** for high availability.
- Maintain **audit logs** for all inventory changes.

**Validation**:
- Conduct **system audits** to verify data integrity and availability.
- Perform **load testing** to ensure the system meets performance requirements.

---

### 18. **Security Measures**

To meet the compliance requirements and ensure data security, the following measures will be implemented:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Restrict access to features and data based on user roles (Admin, Retail Partner, Warehouse Manager).
   - Use **AWS IAM roles** for secure access to cloud resources.

2. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt all data at rest using **AES-256**.
   - Encrypt data in transit using **TLS/HTTPS**.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Log all user actions, including data access, modifications, and deletions.
   - Store logs securely and ensure they are tamper-proof.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for Admin users.
   - Implement **OAuth 2.0** for secure user authentication.

5. **Data Backup and Recovery**:
   - Configure **automated backups** in AWS.
   - Test recovery procedures regularly to ensure data can be restored in case of failure.

6. **Network Security**:
   - Use **AWS VPC** to isolate the system's network.
   - Configure **firewalls** and **security groups** to restrict access.

---

### 19. **Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the data necessary for system functionality.
   - Avoid storing sensitive data unless absolutely required.

2. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
   - Allow users to withdraw consent at any time.

3. **Data Retention**:
   - Define a data retention policy and delete data that is no longer needed.
   - Retain audit logs for a minimum of 5 years for compliance purposes.

4. **Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize data used for analytics to protect user privacy.

---

### 20. **Audit Controls**

1. **Change Logs**:
   - Maintain logs of all changes to inventory data, user roles, and system configurations.

2. **Access Logs**:
   - Log all user access to the system, including login attempts and data access.

3. **Periodic Audits**:
   - Conduct regular audits to verify compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable regulations.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Use **AWS CloudWatch** to monitor system performance and security.

---

### 21. **Compliance Validation**

To ensure compliance during and after implementation, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Development Phase**:
   - Conduct **code reviews** to ensure security and compliance requirements are met.
   - Perform **unit testing** for all compliance-related features.

2. **Pre-Deployment**:
   - Conduct **penetration testing** to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
   - Perform **compliance audits** to verify adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and other standards.

3. **Post-Deployment**:
   - Monitor the system using **AWS CloudWatch** and **audit logs**.
   - Schedule **annual compliance reviews** and **security assessments**.

4. **User Training**:
   - Provide training to users on data privacy and security best practices.

---

### 22. **Conclusion**

By incorporating the outlined compliance requirements, security measures, and audit controls, the Retail Inventory Management System will meet all relevant regulatory standards, including GDPR and CCPA. These measures will ensure the system is secure, reliable, and compliant, providing a robust solution for retail partners, supply chain teams, and warehouse managers.
