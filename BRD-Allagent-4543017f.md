### Updated BRD with Compliance Standards and Validation

---

### 22. **Compliance Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following regulations have been identified as applicable based on the business requirements:

#### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

**Applicability**: GDPR applies as the system processes personal data of users (e.g., email addresses, usernames).

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data such as `password_hash` and `email`.
- **Right to Access and Erasure**: Provide users with the ability to access and delete their personal data.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
- **Data Retention Policy**: Define and enforce a policy for retaining and deleting user data.

**Implementation**:
- Encrypt sensitive fields (`password_hash`, `email`) using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
- Implement APIs to allow users to request access to or deletion of their data.
- Log and monitor all access to personal data in the `Audit_Logs` table.
- Define a data retention policy and implement automated deletion of inactive user accounts after a specified period.

#### **2. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**

**Applicability**: If the system integrates with payment processing for sales, PCI-DSS compliance is required.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Secure Data Transmission**: Use TLS/SSL for all data transmitted over the network.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to payment-related data to authorized personnel only.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed logs of all payment-related activities.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and apply security patches.

**Implementation**:
- Ensure all payment-related data is transmitted over HTTPS.
- Use role-based access control (`role` field in `Users` table) to restrict access to payment data.
- Log all payment-related actions in the `Audit_Logs` table.
- Schedule regular vulnerability scans and updates.

#### **3. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

**Applicability**: If the system handles any health-related data (e.g., inventory of medical supplies), HIPAA compliance is required.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all health-related data at rest and in transit.
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized users can access health-related data.
- **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access to health-related data.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure the integrity of health-related data through validation and error-checking mechanisms.

**Implementation**:
- Encrypt health-related data in the `Inventory` table.
- Use role-based access control to restrict access to health-related data.
- Log all access to health-related data in the `Audit_Logs` table.
- Implement validation checks for health-related data entries.

#### **4. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**

**Applicability**: CCPA applies if the system is used by businesses operating in California and meets the thresholds for compliance.

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **Right to Know**: Allow users to know what personal data is being collected and how it is used.
- **Right to Delete**: Allow users to request deletion of their personal data.
- **Opt-Out of Sale**: Provide users with the ability to opt out of the sale of their personal data.
- **Non-Discrimination**: Ensure users are not discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.

**Implementation**:
- Provide a privacy policy detailing data collection and usage.
- Implement APIs to allow users to request access to or deletion of their data.
- Ensure no personal data is sold or shared without explicit user consent.

### 23. **Security Measures**

To meet the compliance requirements and ensure the security of the system, the following measures will be implemented:

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data fields (`password_hash`, `email`) using AES-256.
   - Use TLS/SSL for all data transmitted over the network.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control using the `role` field in the `Users` table.
   - Restrict access to sensitive data and actions based on user roles.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Log all user actions in the `Audit_Logs` table.
   - Include details such as `user_id`, `action`, and `timestamp`.

4. **Data Masking**:
   - Mask sensitive data (e.g., email addresses) in logs and reports.

5. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

### 24. **Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Minimization**:
   - Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.

2. **Data Retention**:
   - Define and enforce a data retention policy for user and sales data.

3. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit user consent for data collection and processing.

4. **Data Access**:
   - Provide users with the ability to access and delete their personal data.

---

### 25. **Audit Controls**

1. **Audit Log Table**:
   - Use the `Audit_Logs` table to log all user actions.
   - Include details such as `user_id`, `action`, and `timestamp`.

2. **Access Monitoring**:
   - Monitor and review access logs regularly to detect unauthorized access.

3. **Compliance Audits**:
   - Conduct regular compliance audits to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.

---

### 26. **Compliance Validation**

To validate compliance during and after implementation, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Pre-Implementation**:
   - Conduct a compliance review of the system design and database schema.
   - Perform a security assessment to identify and address vulnerabilities.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Test the system against compliance requirements (e.g., data encryption, access control).
   - Validate the functionality of APIs for data access and deletion.

3. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Conduct a compliance audit to ensure the system meets all regulatory requirements.
   - Monitor the system for compliance violations and address them promptly.

4. **Ongoing Validation**:
   - Schedule regular compliance audits and security assessments.
   - Update the system to address changes in regulatory requirements.

### 27. **Conclusion**

The updated BRD now includes compliance standards, security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls to ensure the Retail Inventory Management System meets all relevant regulatory requirements. By implementing these measures, the system will provide a secure and compliant environment for managing inventory, sales, and user data.
