# Project Requirements

# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
The **Retail Inventory Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline inventory management for retail partners, the PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers. The system aims to provide real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis to optimize stock levels, predict restocking needs, and minimize waste.

## 2. Compliance and Regulatory Standards

### Overview
To ensure the system complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following regulations have been identified as applicable based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the collection and processing of personal data (e.g., user information such as email addresses and usernames).
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system integrates with payment processing for sales transactions.
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Not applicable as the system does not process health-related data.
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system processes data of California residents.
5. **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)**: Applicable for audit controls and financial data integrity, especially for sales and revenue tracking.

### Compliance Requirements and Implementation

#### 1. **GDPR Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Obtain explicit consent for collecting and processing personal data.
     - Provide users with the ability to access, modify, and delete their data.
     - Ensure data is stored securely and encrypted.
     - Implement data breach notification processes.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Add a consent mechanism during user registration.
     - Provide a user dashboard for managing personal data.
     - Encrypt sensitive data such as `password_hash` and `email` in the `Users` table.
     - Implement logging and monitoring for data breaches, with alerts for administrators.
   - **Validation**:
     - Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).
     - Perform regular audits to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.

#### 2. **PCI-DSS Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Encrypt payment-related data during transmission and storage.
     - Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.
     - Implement strong access control measures and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
     - Regularly test and monitor security systems.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use a third-party payment gateway for processing transactions to offload PCI-DSS compliance.
     - Ensure the `Sales` table does not store sensitive payment information.
     - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for users accessing sales data.
   - **Validation**:
     - Obtain an Attestation of Compliance (AOC) from the payment gateway provider.
     - Conduct vulnerability scans and penetration testing.

#### 3. **CCPA Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Provide users with the ability to opt-out of data sharing.
     - Disclose what data is being collected and how it is used.
     - Allow users to request deletion of their data.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Add a privacy policy page detailing data collection and usage.
     - Implement an opt-out mechanism for data sharing.
     - Extend the user dashboard to include a "Delete My Data" feature.
   - **Validation**:
     - Perform regular reviews of the privacy policy.
     - Conduct user testing to ensure the opt-out and data deletion features work as intended.

#### 4. **SOX Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Maintain accurate and auditable financial records.
     - Implement controls to prevent unauthorized access to financial data.
     - Ensure logs are immutable and tamper-proof.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use the `Logs` table to track all actions related to financial data.
     - Implement database triggers to log changes to the `Sales` table.
     - Use a write-once, read-many (WORM) storage solution for logs.
   - **Validation**:
     - Conduct regular audits of financial records and logs.
     - Implement automated alerts for suspicious activities.

### Security Measures

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive fields such as `password_hash` and `email` in the `Users` table.
   - Use TLS for all data transmitted between the client and server.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the `role` field in the `Users` table.
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative users.

3. **Audit Controls**:
   - Use the `Logs` table to track all user actions and system events.
   - Implement triggers to log changes to critical tables such as `Inventory`, `Sales`, and `Restocking Alerts`.

4. **Data Retention and Deletion**:
   - Define a data retention policy for logs and sales data.
   - Implement automated deletion of outdated data in compliance with GDPR and CCPA.

---

### Data Privacy Rules

1. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection during user registration.
   - Provide a clear and concise privacy policy.

2. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the data necessary for the system to function (e.g., avoid storing unnecessary personal information).

3. **Right to Access and Deletion**:
   - Allow users to view, modify, and delete their data via the user dashboard.

---

### Validation of Compliance

#### During Implementation
1. **Code Reviews**:
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure encryption and access control mechanisms are implemented correctly.
2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Perform penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
3. **Compliance Audits**:
   - Engage third-party auditors to verify compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other applicable standards.

#### Post-Implementation
1. **Monitoring**:
   - Use monitoring tools to detect and respond to security incidents.
2. **Regular Audits**:
   - Schedule regular audits to ensure ongoing compliance.
3. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect feedback from users to identify and address privacy concerns.

## 3. Integration with BRD

The compliance and regulatory standards outlined above align with the business requirements by:
- Ensuring secure user authentication and data privacy through GDPR and CCPA compliance.
- Protecting financial data integrity and auditability through SOX compliance.
- Facilitating secure sales transactions by adhering to PCI-DSS standards.

This integration ensures that the **Retail Inventory Management System** not only meets business objectives but also adheres to legal and regulatory requirements, providing a secure and trustworthy platform for all stakeholders.
