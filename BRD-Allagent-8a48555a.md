# Project Requirements

# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
The **Retail Inventory Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline inventory management for retail partners, the PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers. The system aims to provide real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis to optimize stock levels, predict restocking needs, and minimize waste.

## 2. Compliance and Regulatory Standards

### Overview
To ensure the system complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following regulations have been identified as applicable based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the collection and processing of personal data (e.g., user email addresses).
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system processes payment information (e.g., sales transactions involving credit card payments).
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Not applicable unless the system processes protected health information (PHI).
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system serves California residents and processes personal data.

### 3. Compliance Requirements and Implementation

#### 3.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
**Key Requirements**:
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect data necessary for the system's functionality.
- **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
- **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access and delete their personal data.
- **Data Security**: Implement measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Notify authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Minimization**: Limit user data collection to `email`, `password_hash`, and `role`.
- **Consent Management**: Add a consent checkbox during user registration.
- **Access and Erasure**: Provide a user interface for users to view and delete their data.
- **Data Security**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., `password_hash`) and use HTTPS for all communications.
- **Breach Notification**: Implement a monitoring system to detect breaches and notify stakeholders.

#### 3.2 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)
**Key Requirements**:
- **Secure Storage**: Do not store sensitive payment data unless absolutely necessary.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt payment data during transmission and storage.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs of all access to payment data.

**Implementation**:
- **Secure Storage**: Avoid storing credit card information; integrate with a PCI-compliant payment gateway.
- **Encryption**: Use TLS for data transmission and AES-256 for any stored sensitive data.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to payment data.
- **Audit Trails**: Log all access to payment-related data in a secure, tamper-proof system.

#### 3.3 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
**Key Requirements**:
- **Data Transparency**: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
- **Opt-Out**: Allow users to opt out of data collection and sale.
- **Data Access and Deletion**: Provide users with access to their data and the ability to delete it.

**Implementation**:
- **Data Transparency**: Include a privacy policy detailing data collection practices.
- **Opt-Out**: Add an opt-out mechanism for data collection.
- **Access and Deletion**: Extend GDPR-compliant access and deletion features to meet CCPA requirements.

### 4. Security Measures

To ensure compliance with the above regulations, the following security measures will be implemented:

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., `password_hash`, payment data) using industry-standard algorithms.
   - Use HTTPS for all data transmissions.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.

3. **Audit Controls**:
   - Maintain detailed logs of all user actions, including data access and modifications.
   - Store logs in a secure, tamper-proof system.

4. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize personal data where possible to reduce compliance risks.

5. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

---

### 5. Data Privacy Rules

1. **User Data**:
   - Collect only the minimum data required for system functionality.
   - Allow users to view, update, and delete their data.

2. **Payment Data**:
   - Do not store sensitive payment data unless absolutely necessary.
   - Use a PCI-compliant payment gateway for processing transactions.

3. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose.
   - Implement automatic data deletion policies for inactive accounts.

---

### 6. Audit Controls

1. **Logging**:
   - Log all user actions, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
   - Log all administrative actions, including role changes and data deletions.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement real-time monitoring to detect suspicious activities.
   - Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to identify potential threats.

3. **Reporting**:
   - Generate regular compliance reports for internal and external audits.
   - Provide audit logs to regulatory authorities upon request.

---

### 7. Compliance Validation

#### During Implementation:
1. **Code Reviews**:
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure compliance with data security and privacy standards.
2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Perform penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
3. **Compliance Checklists**:
   - Use checklists to verify compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA requirements.

#### After Implementation:
1. **Regular Audits**:
   - Conduct regular audits to ensure ongoing compliance.
2. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect user feedback to identify potential compliance issues.
3. **Third-Party Assessments**:
   - Engage third-party auditors to validate compliance with regulatory standards.

---

### 8. Integration with Database Schema

The database schema outlined in the BRD will be updated to include fields and mechanisms necessary for compliance:

1. **Users Table**:
   - Add a `consent_given` (BOOLEAN) field to track GDPR consent.
   - Add a `data_deleted_at` (TIMESTAMP, Nullable) field to track data deletion requests.

2. **Audit Logs Table**:
   - Create a new table to store audit logs:
     - `log_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
     - `user_id` (Foreign Key, UUID)
     - `action` (VARCHAR)
     - `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP)
     - `details` (TEXT)

3. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., `password_hash`) in the database.

4. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) at the database level.

This updated BRD ensures the system is compliant with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards while maintaining scalability, security, and usability.
