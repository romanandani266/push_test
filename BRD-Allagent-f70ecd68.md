## 2. Compliance Standards

### Overview
The system must comply with the following regulatory and compliance standards based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the handling of personal data of users, including names, emails, and other identifiable information.
2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Applicable if the system processes or stores Protected Health Information (PHI).
3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system processes or stores payment card information.
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system handles personal data of California residents.
5. **ISO/IEC 27001**: Recommended for ensuring a robust Information Security Management System (ISMS).

## 3. Security Measures

### 3.1 Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive fields in the database.
- **In Transit**: Use TLS 1.2 or higher for all data transmissions.

### 3.2 Access Control
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the `Users` and `Roles` tables.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.

### 3.3 Monitoring and Logging
- Enable logging for all access and modifications to sensitive data.
- Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for real-time monitoring.

### 3.4 Incident Response
- Define an incident response plan and conduct regular drills.
- Maintain a dedicated team for handling security incidents.

---

## 4. Data Privacy Rules

### 4.1 Consent Management
- Use a consent management platform to track user consents.
- Store consent records in a dedicated table for audit purposes.

### 4.2 Data Retention
- Define retention periods for each type of data.
- Implement automated scripts to delete data after the retention period expires.

### 4.3 Anonymization
- Anonymize data used for analytics to prevent identification of individuals.

---

## 5. Audit Controls

### 5.1 Audit Logs
- Maintain logs for all CRUD operations on sensitive data.
- Store logs in a tamper-proof system.

### 5.2 Regular Audits
- Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
- Use third-party auditors for an unbiased assessment.
