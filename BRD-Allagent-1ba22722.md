# Project Requirements

To ensure the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following section will be added to the Business Requirements Document (BRD). This section will analyze the applicable compliance standards, outline their requirements, and specify how the system will meet them. Additionally, security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls will be documented, along with instructions for validating compliance during and after implementation.

## **13. Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

### **13.1 Applicable Compliance Standards**
Based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** - Applicable if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU).
2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** - Applicable if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI).
3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)** - Applicable if the system processes payment card information.
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** - Applicable if the system processes personal data of California residents.
5. **ISO/IEC 27001** - Applicable for ensuring information security management.

### **13.2 Compliance Requirements and Implementation**

#### **1. GDPR**
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Data minimization: Collect only the data necessary for the purpose.
  - Consent: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
  - Right to access, rectify, and delete data.
  - Data breach notification within 72 hours.
  - Data protection by design and by default.

- **Implementation:**
  - Implement a consent management system for data collection.
  - Provide a user interface for accessing, rectifying, and deleting personal data.
  - Encrypt all personal data at rest and in transit.
  - Maintain an incident response plan for data breaches.
  - Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing activities.

#### **2. HIPAA**
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI.
  - Implement access controls and audit trails.
  - Encrypt PHI at rest and in transit.
  - Conduct regular risk assessments.
  - Sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with third-party vendors.

- **Implementation:**
  - Use role-based access controls to limit access to PHI.
  - Log all access and modifications to PHI for auditing purposes.
  - Encrypt PHI using industry-standard algorithms.
  - Perform regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
  - Ensure all third-party vendors handling PHI sign BAAs.

#### **3. PCI-DSS**
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Protect cardholder data through encryption and tokenization.
  - Implement strong access control measures.
  - Regularly monitor and test networks.
  - Maintain a secure network and systems.

- **Implementation:**
  - Store payment card data in a tokenized format.
  - Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to secure the network.
  - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
  - Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis.

#### **4. CCPA**
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Provide transparency about data collection and usage.
  - Allow users to opt out of data selling.
  - Provide mechanisms for data access, deletion, and portability.

- **Implementation:**
  - Update the privacy policy to include CCPA-specific disclosures.
  - Implement a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" button on the website.
  - Provide a user interface for data access, deletion, and portability requests.

#### **5. ISO/IEC 27001**
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS).
  - Conduct regular risk assessments and audits.
  - Implement security controls to mitigate identified risks.

- **Implementation:**
  - Develop and maintain an ISMS aligned with ISO/IEC 27001.
  - Conduct regular internal and external audits.
  - Implement security controls such as encryption, access controls, and monitoring.

### **13.3 Security Measures**
- **Encryption:** All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, PHI, payment card data) will be encrypted using AES-256 or equivalent.
- **Access Controls:** Role-based access controls (RBAC) will be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Audit Trails:** All access and modifications to sensitive data will be logged for auditing purposes.
- **Network Security:** Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) will be deployed.
- **Data Masking:** Sensitive data will be masked in non-production environments.

---

### **13.4 Data Privacy Rules**
- **Data Retention:** Personal data will be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.
- **Data Anonymization:** Data will be anonymized where possible to reduce privacy risks.
- **User Rights:** Users will have the ability to access, rectify, and delete their personal data through a self-service portal.

---

### **13.5 Audit Controls**
- **Automated Monitoring:** Implement automated tools to monitor compliance with security and privacy policies.
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular internal and external audits to ensure compliance with applicable standards.
- **Incident Reporting:** Maintain a system for reporting and tracking security incidents.

---

### **13.6 Compliance Validation**
- **During Implementation:**
  - Conduct a compliance review at each stage of development.
  - Perform security testing, including vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
  - Validate encryption and access control mechanisms.

- **After Implementation:**
  - Conduct regular compliance audits.
  - Monitor for changes in regulatory requirements and update the system accordingly.
  - Use automated tools to continuously monitor compliance.
